<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;All these common features of English landscape evince a
calm and settled security, and hereditary transmission of home-bred
virtues and local attachments, that speak deeply and
touchingly for the moral character of the nation.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Washington
Irving&rsquo;s</span> <i>Sketch Book</i>.</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a great saying of my poor mother&rsquo;s, especially
if my father had been out of spirits about the crops,
or the rise in wages, or our prospects, and had thought
better of it again, and showed her the bright side of
things, &ldquo;Well, my dear, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve much to be
thankful for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which they had, and especially, I often think, for
the fact that I was not the eldest son. I gave them
more trouble than I can think of with a comfortable
conscience as it was; but they had Jem to tread in
my father&rsquo;s shoes, and he was a good son to them&mdash;<span class="smcap">God</span>
bless him for it!</p>

<p>I can remember hearing my father say&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad
enough to have Jack with his nose in a book, and his
head in the clouds, on a fine June day, with the hay<!-- Page 8 -->
all out, and the glass falling: but if Jem had been a
lad of whims and fancies, I think it would have broken
my poor old heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I often wonder what made me bother my head
with books, and where the perverse spirit came from
that possessed me, and tore me, and drove me forth
into the world. It did not come from my parents.
My mother&rsquo;s family were far from being literary or
even enterprising, and my father&rsquo;s people were a race
of small yeomen squires, whose talk was of dogs and
horses and cattle, and the price of hay. We were
north-of-England people, but not of a commercial or
adventurous class, though we were within easy reach
of some of the great manufacturing centres. Quiet
country folk we were; old-fashioned, and boastful of
our old-fashionedness, albeit it meant little more than
that our manners and customs were a generation
behindhand of the more cultivated folk, who live
nearer to London. We were proud of our name too,
which is written in the earliest registers and records of
the parish, honourably connected with the land we
lived on; but which may be searched for in vain in
the lists of great or even learned Englishmen.</p>

<p>It never troubled dear old Jem that there had not
been a man of mark among all the men who had
handed on our name from generation to generation.
He had no feverish ambitions, and as to books, I<!-- Page 9 -->
doubt if he ever opened a volume, if he could avoid
it, after he wore out three horn-books and our mother&rsquo;s
patience in learning his letters&mdash;not even the mottle-backed
prayer-books which were handed round for
family prayers, and out of which we said the psalms
for the day, verse about with my father. I generally
found the place, and Jem put his arm over my
shoulder and read with me.</p>

<p>He was a yeoman born. I can just remember&mdash;when
I was not three years old and he was barely four&mdash;the
fright our mother got from his fearless familiarity
with the beasts about the homestead. He and I were
playing on the grass-plat before the house when Dolly,
an ill-tempered dun cow we knew well by sight and
name, got into the garden and drew near us. As I sat
on the grass&mdash;my head at no higher level than the
buttercups in the field beyond&mdash;Dolly loomed so large
above me that I felt frightened and began to cry. But
Jem, only conscious that she had no business there,
picked up a stick nearly as big as himself, and trotted
indignantly to drive her out. Our mother caught
sight of him from an upper window, and knowing that
the temper of the cow was not to be trusted, she called
wildly to Jem, &ldquo;Come in, dear, quick! Come in!
Dolly&rsquo;s loose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drive her out!&rdquo; was Master Jem&rsquo;s reply; and
<!-- Page 10 -->with his little straw hat well on the back of his head,
he waddled bravely up to the cow, flourishing his
stick. The process interested me, and I dried my
tears and encouraged my brother; but Dolly looked
sourly at him, and began to lower her horns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoo! shoo!&rdquo; shouted Jem, waving his arms in
farming-man fashion, and belabouring Dolly&rsquo;s neck
with the stick. &ldquo;Shoo! shoo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dolly planted her forefeet, and dipped her head for
a push, but catching another small whack on her face,
and more authoritative &ldquo;Shoos!&rdquo; she changed her
mind, and swinging heavily round, trotted off towards
the field, followed by Jem, waving, shouting, and
victorious. My mother got out in time to help him to
fasten the gate, which he was much too small to do by
himself, though, with true squirely instincts, he was
trying to secure it.</p>

<p>But from our earliest days we both lived on
intimate terms with all the live stock. &ldquo;Laddie,&rdquo; an
old black cart-horse, was one of our chief friends.
Jem and I used to sit, one behind the other, on his
broad back, when our little legs could barely straddle
across, and to &ldquo;grip&rdquo; with our knees in orthodox
fashion was a matter of principle, but impossible in
practice. Laddie&rsquo;s pace was always discreet, however,
and I do not think we should have found a saddle any
improvement, even as to safety, upon his warm, satin-<!-- Page 11 -->smooth
back. We steered him more by shouts and
smacks than by the one short end of a dirty rope
which was our apology for reins; that is, if we had any
hand in guiding his course. I am now disposed to
think that Laddie guided himself.</p>

<p>But our beast friends were many. The yellow
yard-dog always slobbered joyfully at our approach;
partly moved, I fancy, by love for us, and partly by
the exciting hope of being let off his chain. When we
went into the farmyard the fowls came running to our
feet for corn, the pigeons fluttered down over our
heads for peas, and the pigs humped themselves
against the wall of the sty as tightly as they could
lean, in hopes of having their backs scratched. The
long sweet faces of the plough horses, as they turned
in the furrows, were as familiar to us as the faces of
any other labourers in our father&rsquo;s fields, and we got
fond of the lambs and ducks and chickens, and got
used to their being killed and eaten when our
acquaintance reached a certain date, like other farm-bred
folk, which is one amongst the many proofs of
the adaptability of human nature.</p>

<p>So far so good, on my part as well as Jem&rsquo;s. That
I should like the animals &ldquo;on the place&rdquo;&mdash;the
domesticated animals, the workable animals, the
eatable animals&mdash;this was right and natural, and
befitting my father&rsquo;s son. But my far greater fancy for
<!-- Page 12 -->wild, queer, useless, mischievous, and even disgusting
creatures often got me into trouble. Want of
sympathy became absolute annoyance as I grew older,
and wandered farther, and adopted a perfect menagerie
of odd beasts in whom my friends could see no good
qualities: such as the snake I kept warm in my
trousers-pocket; the stickleback that I am convinced
I tamed in its own waters; the toad for whom I built
a red house of broken drainpipes at the back of the
strawberry bed, where I used to go and tickle his head
on the sly; and the long-whiskered rat in the barn,
who knew me well, and whose death nearly broke my
heart, though I had seen generations of unoffending
ducklings pass to the kitchen without a tear.</p>

<p>I think it must have been the beasts that made me
take to reading: I was so fond of Buffon&rsquo;s <i>Natural
History</i>, of which there was an English abridgment on
the dining-room bookshelves.</p>

<p>But my happiest reading days began after the
bookseller&rsquo;s agent came round, and teased my father
into taking in the <i>Penny Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>; and those
numbers in which there was a beast, bird, fish, or
reptile were the numbers for me!</p>

<p>I must, however, confess that if a love for reading
had been the only way in which I had gone astray from
the family habits and traditions, I don&rsquo;t think I should
have had much to complain of in the way of blame.</p>

<p><!-- Page 13 -->My father &ldquo;pish&rdquo;ed and &ldquo;pshaw&rdquo;ed when he
caught me &ldquo;poking over&rdquo; books, but my dear mother
was inclined to regard me as a genius, whose learning
might bring renown of a new kind into the family. In
a quiet way of her own, as she went gently about
household matters, or knitted my father&rsquo;s stockings,
she was a great day-dreamer&mdash;one of the most unselfish
kind, however; a builder of air-castles, for those she
loved to dwell in; planned, fitted, and furnished
according to the measure of her affections.</p>

<p>It was perhaps because my father always began by
disparaging her suggestions that (by the balancing
action of some instinctive sense of justice) he almost
always ended by adopting them, whether they were
wise or foolish. He came at last to listen very
tolerantly when she dilated on my future greatness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if he isn&rsquo;t quite so good a farmer as Jem,
it&rsquo;s not as if he were the eldest, you know, my dear.
I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve much to be thankful for that dear Jem
takes after you as he does. But if Jack turns out a
genius, which please God we may live to see and be
proud of, he&rsquo;ll make plenty of money, and he must
live with Jem when we&rsquo;re gone, and let Jem manage it
for him, for clever people are never any good at
taking care of what they get. And when their families
get too big for the old house, love, Jack must build,
as he&rsquo;ll be well able to afford to do, and Jem must let
<!-- Page 14 -->him have the land. The Ladycroft would be as good
as anywhere, and a pretty name for the house. It
would be a good thing to have some one at that end of
the property too, and then the boys would always be
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor dear mother! The kernel of her speech lay
in the end of it&mdash;&ldquo;The boys would always be
together.&rdquo; I am sure in her tender heart she blessed
my bookish genius, which was to make wealth as well
as fame, and so keep me &ldquo;about the place,&rdquo; and the
home birds for ever in the nest.</p>

<p>I knew nothing of it then, of course; but at this
time she used to turn my father&rsquo;s footsteps towards the
Ladycroft every Sunday, between the services, and
never wearied of planning my house.</p>

<p>She was standing one day, her smooth brow knitted
in perplexity, before the big pink thorn, and had stood
so long absorbed in this brown study, that my father
said, with a sly smile,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, love, and where are you now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the dairy, my dear,&rdquo; she answered quite
gravely. &ldquo;The window is to the north of course, and
I&rsquo;m afraid the thorn must come down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My father laughed heartily. He had some sense
of humour, but my mother had none. She was one of
the sweetest-tempered women that ever lived, and
never dreamed that any one was laughing at her. I
<!-- Page 15 -->have heard my father say she lay awake that night, and
when he asked her why she could not sleep he found
she was fretting about the pink thorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looked so pretty to-day, my dear; and thorns
are so bad to move!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My father knew her too well to hope to console
her by joking about it. He said gravely: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
plenty of time yet, love. The boys are only just
in trousers; and we may think of some way to spare it
before we come to bricks and mortar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of it every way, my dear, I&rsquo;m
afraid,&rdquo; said my mother with a sigh. But she had full
confidence in my father&mdash;a trouble shared with him
was half cured, and she soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>She certainly had a vivid imagination, though
it never was cultivated to literary ends. Perhaps,
after all, I inherited that idle fancy, those unsatisfied
yearnings of my restless heart, from her! Mental
peculiarities are said to come from one&rsquo;s mother.</p>

<p>It was Jem who inherited her sweet temper.</p>

<p>Dear old Jem! He and I were the best of good
friends always, and that sweet temper of his had
no doubt much to do with it. He was very much led
by me, though I was the younger, and whatever
mischief we got into it was always my fault.</p>

<p>It was I who persuaded him to run away from
school, under the, as it proved, insufficient disguise of
<!-- Page 16 -->walnut-juice on our faces and hands. It was I who
began to dig the hole which was to take us through
from the kitchen-garden to the other side of the
world. (Jem helped me to fill it up again, when
the gardener made a fuss about our having chosen
the asparagus-bed as the point of departure, which
we did because the earth was soft there.) In desert
islands or castles, balloons or boats, my hand was
first and foremost, and mischief or amusement of
every kind, by earth, air, or water, was planned for us
by me.</p>

<p>Now and then, however, Jem could crow over me.
How he did deride me when I asked our mother the
foolish question&mdash;&ldquo;Have bees whiskers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bee who betrayed me into this folly was a
bumble of the utmost beauty. The bars of his coat
&ldquo;burned&rdquo; as &ldquo;brightly&rdquo; as those of the tiger in
Wombwell&rsquo;s menagerie, and his fur was softer than my
mother&rsquo;s black velvet mantle. I knew, for I had
kissed him lightly as he sat on the window-frame. I
had seen him brushing first one side and then the
other side of his head, with an action so exactly that
of my father brushing his whiskers on Sunday morning,
that I thought the bee might be trimming his; not
knowing that he was sweeping the flower-dust off his
antennæ with his legs, and putting it into his waistcoat
pocket to make bee bread of.</p>

<p><!-- Page 17 -->It was the liberty I took in kissing him that made
him not sit still any more, and hindered me from
examining his cheeks for myself. He began to dance
all over the window, humming his own tune, and
before he got tired of dancing he found a chink open
at the top sash, and sailed away like a spot of plush
upon the air.</p>

<p>I had thus no opportunity of becoming intimate
with him, but he was the cause of a more lasting
friendship&mdash;my friendship with Isaac Irvine, the bee-keeper.
For when I asked that silly question, my
mother said, &ldquo;Not that I ever saw, love;&rdquo; and my
father said, &ldquo;If he wants to know about bees, he
should go to old Isaac. He&rsquo;ll tell him plenty of queer
stories about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first time I saw the beekeeper was in church,
on Catechism Sunday, in circumstances which led to
my disgracing myself in a manner that must have been
very annoying to my mother, who had taken infinite
pains in teaching us.</p>

<p>The provoking part of it was that I had not had a
fear of breaking down. With poor Jem it was very
different. He took twice as much pains as I did, but
he could not get things into his head, and even if they
did stick there he found it almost harder to say them
properly. We began to learn the Catechism when we
were three years old, and we went on till long after we
<!-- Page 18 -->were in trousers; and I am sure Jem never got the
three words &ldquo;and an inheritor&rdquo; tidily off the tip of his
tongue within my remembrance. And I have seen
both him and my mother crying over them on a hot
Sunday afternoon. He was always in a fright when
we had to say the Catechism in church, and that day,
I remember, he shook so that I could hardly stand
straight myself, and Bob Furniss, the blacksmith&rsquo;s
son, who stood on the other side of him, whispered
quite loud, &ldquo;Eh! see thee, how Master Jem <i>dodders</i>!&rdquo;
for which Jem gave him an eye as black as his father&rsquo;s
shop afterwards, for Jem could use his fists if he could
not learn by heart.</p>

<p>But at the time he could not even compose himself
enough to count down the line of boys and calculate
what question would come to him. I did, and when
he found he had only got the First Commandment, he
was more at ease, and though the second, which fell
to me, is much longer, I was not in the least afraid
of forgetting it, for I could have done the whole
of my duty to my neighbour if it had been necessary.</p>

<p>Jem got through very well, and I could hear my
mother blessing him over the top of the pew behind
our backs; but just as he finished, no less than three
bees, who had been hovering over the heads of the
workhouse boys opposite, all settled down together on
Isaac Irvine&rsquo;s bare hand.</p>

<p><!-- Page 19 -->At the public catechising, which came once a year,
and after the second lesson at evening prayer, the
grown-up members of the congregation used to draw
near to the end of their pews to see and hear how we
acquitted ourselves, and, as it happened on this
particular occasion, Master Isaac was standing exactly
opposite to me. As he leaned forward, his hands
crossed on the pew-top before him, I had been a good
deal fascinated by his face, which was a very noble one
in its rugged way, with snow-white hair and intense,
keenly observing eyes, and when I saw the three bees
settle on him without his seeming to notice it, I cried,
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll sting you!&rdquo; before I thought of what I was
doing; for I had been severely stung that week myself,
and knew what it felt like, and how little good powder-blue
does.</p>

<p>With attending to the bees I had not heard the
parson say, &ldquo;Second Commandment?&rdquo; and as he
was rather deaf he did not hear what I said. But of
course he knew it was not long enough for the right
answer, and he said, &ldquo;Speak up, my boy,&rdquo; and Jem
tried to start me by whispering, &ldquo;Thou shalt not
make to thyself&rdquo;&mdash;but the three bees went on sitting
on Master Isaac&rsquo;s hand, and though I began the
Second Commandment, I could not take my eyes off
them, and when Master Isaac saw this he smiled and
<!-- Page 20 -->nodded his white head, and said, &ldquo;Never you mind
me, sir. They won&rsquo;t sting the old beekeeper.&rdquo; This
assertion so completely turned my head that every
other idea went out of it, and after saying &ldquo;or in the
earth beneath&rdquo; three times, and getting no further, the
parson called out, &ldquo;Third Commandment?&rdquo; and
I was passed over&mdash;&ldquo;out of respect to the family,&rdquo; as
I was reminded for a twelvemonth afterwards&mdash;and
Jem pinched my leg to comfort me, and my mother
sank down on the seat, and did not take her face out
of her pocket-handkerchief till the workhouse boys
were saying &ldquo;the sacraments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My mother was our only teacher till Jem was nine
and I was eight years old. We had a thin, soft-backed
reading book, bound in black cloth, on the cover of
which in gold letters was its name, <i>Chick-seed
without Chick-weed</i>; and in this book she wrote
our names, and the date at the end of each lesson we
conned fairly through. I had got into Part II., which
was &ldquo;in words of four letters,&rdquo; and had the chapter
about the Ship in it, before Jem&rsquo;s name figured at the
end of the chapter about the Dog in Part I.</p>

<p>My mother was very glad that this chapter seemed
to please Jem, and that he learned to read it quickly,
for, good-natured as he was, Jem was too fond of
fighting and laying about him: and though it was only
<!-- Page 21 -->&ldquo;in words of three letters,&rdquo; this brief chapter contained
a terrible story, and an excellent moral, which I
remember well even now.</p>

<p>It was called &ldquo;The Dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you cry? The Dog has bit my leg.
Why did he do so? I had my bat and I hit him as
he lay on the mat, so he ran at me and bit my leg.
Ah, you may not use the bat if you hit the Dog. It is
a hot day, and the Dog may go mad. One day a Dog
bit a boy in the arm, and the boy had his arm cut off,
for the Dog was mad. And did the boy die? Yes,
he did die in a day or two. It is not fit to hit a Dog
if he lie on the mat and is not a bad Dog. Do not hit
a Dog, or a cat, or a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jem not only got through this lesson much better
than usual, but he lingered at my mother&rsquo;s knees, to
point with his own little stumpy forefinger to each
recurrence of the words &ldquo;hit a Dog,&rdquo; and read them
all by himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Very</i> good boy,&rdquo; said Mother, who was much
pleased. &ldquo;And now read this last sentence once more,
and very nicely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;not&mdash;hit&mdash;a&mdash;dog&mdash;or&mdash;a&mdash;cat&mdash;or&mdash;a&mdash;boy,&rdquo;
read Jem in a high sing-song, and with a face of
blank indifference, and then with a hasty dog&rsquo;s-ear he
turned back to the previous page, and spelled out, &ldquo;I
had my bat and I hit him as he lay on the mat&rdquo; so
<!-- Page 22 -->well, that my mother caught him to her bosom and
covered him with kisses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be as good a scholar as Jack yet!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t forget, my darling, that my
Jem must never &lsquo;hit a dog, or a cat, or a boy.&rsquo; Now,
love, you may put the book away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jem stuck out his lips and looked down, and
hesitated. He seemed almost disposed to go on
with his lessons. But he changed his mind, and
shutting the book with a bang, he scampered off.
As he passed the ottoman near the door, he saw
Kitty, our old tortoise-shell puss, lying on it, and
(moved perhaps by the occurrence of the word <i>cat</i>
in the last sentence of the lesson) he gave her such
a whack with the flat side of <i>Chick-seed</i> that she
bounced up into the air like a sky-rocket, Jem crying
out as he did so, &ldquo;I had my bat, and I hit him as
he lay on the mat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was seldom enough that Jem got anything by
heart, but he had certainly learned this; for when an
hour later I went to look for him in the garden, I
found him panting with the exertion of having laid
my nice, thick, fresh green crop of mustard and cress
flat with the back of the coal-shovel, which he could
barely lift, but with which he was still battering my
salad-bed, chanting triumphantly at every stroke, &ldquo;I
had my bat, and I hit him as he lay on the mat.&rdquo;
<!-- Page 23 -->He was quite out of breath, and I had not much
difficulty in pummelling him as he deserved.</p>

<p>Which shows how true it is, as my dear mother
said, that &ldquo;you never know what to do for the best in
bringing up boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just about the time that we outgrew <i>Chick-seed</i>,
and that it was allowed on all hands that even for
quiet country-folk with no learned notions it was high
time we were sent to school, our parents were spared
the trouble of looking out for a school for us by the
fact that a school came to us instead, and nothing
less than an &ldquo;Academy&rdquo; was opened within three-quarters
of a mile of my father&rsquo;s gate.</p>

<p>Walnut-tree Farm was an old house that stood
some little way from the road in our favourite lane&mdash;a
lane full of wild roses and speedwell, with a tiny
footpath of disjointed flags like an old pack-horse
track. Grass and milfoil grew thickly between the
stones, and the turf stretched half-way over the road
from each side, for there was little traffic in the lane,
beyond the yearly rumble of the harvesting waggons;
and few foot-passengers, except a labourer now and
then, a pair or two of rustic lovers at sundown, a few
knots of children in the blackberry season, and the
cows coming home to milking.</p>

<p>Jem and I played there a good deal, but then we
lived close by.</p>

<p><!-- Page 24 -->We were very fond of the old place and there were
two good reasons for the charm it had in our eyes.
In the first place, the old man who lived alone in it
(for it had ceased to be the dwelling-house of a real
farm) was an eccentric old miser, the chief object of
whose existence seemed to be to thwart any attempt
to pry into the daily details of it. What manner of
stimulus this was to boyish curiosity needs no
explanation, much as it needs excuse.</p>

<p>In the second place, Walnut-tree Farm was so
utterly different from the house which was our home,
that everything about it was attractive from mere
unaccustomedness.</p>

<p>Our house had been rebuilt from the foundations
by my father. It was square-built and very ugly, but
it was in such excellent repair that one could never
indulge a more lawless fancy towards any chink or
cranny about it than a desire to &ldquo;point&rdquo; the same
with a bit of mortar.</p>

<p>Why it was that my ancestor, who built the old
house, and who was not a bit better educated or
farther-travelled than my father, had built a pretty
one, whilst my father built an ugly one, is one of the
many things I do not know, and wish I did.</p>

<p>From the old sketches of it which my grandfather
painted on the parlour handscreens, I think it must
have been like a larger edition of the farm; that is,
<!-- Page 25 -->with long mullioned windows, a broad and gracefully
proportioned doorway with several shallow steps and
quaintly-ornamented lintel; bits of fine work and
ornamentation about the woodwork here and there,
put in as if they had been done, not for the look of
the thing, but for the love of it, and whitewash over
the house-front, and over the apple-trees in the
orchard.</p>

<p>That was what our ancestor&rsquo;s home was like; and
it was the sort of house that became Walnut-tree
Academy, where Jem and I went to school.</p>

their countenances</i>); this fellow has a good mortal look, place
him near the corpse; that wainscoat face must be o&rsquo; top of the
stairs; that fellow&rsquo;s almost in a fright (that looks as if he were
full of some strange misery) at the end of the hall. So&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll
fix you all myself. Let&rsquo;s have no laughing now on any provocation.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Funeral</i>, <span class="smcap">Steele</span>.</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> one time I really hoped to make the acquaintance
of the old miser of Walnut-tree Farm. It was
when we saved the life of his cat.</p>

<p>He was very fond of that cat, I think, and it was,
to say the least of it, as eccentric-looking as its
master. One eye was yellow and the other was blue,
which gave it a strange, uncanny expression, and its
rust-coloured fur was not common either as to tint or
markings.</p>

<p>How dear old Jem did belabour the boy we
found torturing it! He was much older and bigger
than we were, but we were two to one, which we
reckoned fair enough, considering his size, and that
the cat had to be saved somehow. The poor thing&rsquo;s
<!-- Page 27 -->forepaws were so much hurt that it could not walk, so
we carried it to the farm, and I stood on the shallow
doorsteps, and under the dial, on which was written&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
&ldquo;Tempora mutantur!&rdquo;&mdash;
</p>

<p>and the old miser came out, and we told him about
the cat, and he took it and said we were good boys,
and I hoped he would have asked us to go in, but he
did not, though we lingered a little; he only put
his hand into his pocket, and very slowly brought out
sixpence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said I, rather indignantly. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t want anything for saving the poor cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very fond of it,&rdquo; he said apologetically,
and putting the sixpence carefully back; but I believe
he alluded to the cat.</p>

<p>I felt more and more strongly that he ought to
invite us into the parlour&mdash;if there was a parlour&mdash;and
I took advantage of a backward movement on
his part to move one shallow step nearer, and said, in
an easy conversational tone, &ldquo;Your cat has very
curious eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came out again, and his own eyes glared in
the evening light as he touched me with one of his
fingers in a way that made me shiver, and said, &ldquo;If I
had been an old woman, and that cat had lived with
me in the days when this house was built, I should
<!-- Page 28 -->have been hanged, or burned as a witch. Twelve
men would have done it&mdash;twelve reasonable and
respectable men!&rdquo; He paused, looking over my
head at the sky, and then added, &ldquo;But in all good
conscience&mdash;mind, in all good conscience!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And after another pause he touched me again
(this time my teeth chattered), and whispered loudly
in my ear, &ldquo;Never serve on a jury.&rdquo; After which he
banged the door in our faces, and Jem caught hold
of my jacket and cried, &ldquo;Oh! he&rsquo;s quite mad, he&rsquo;ll
murder us!&rdquo; and we took each other by the hand and
ran home as fast as our feet would carry us.</p>

<p>We never saw the old miser again, for he died
some months afterwards, and, strange to relate, Jem
and I were invited to the funeral.</p>

<p>It was a funeral not to be forgotten. The old
man had left the money for it, and a memorandum,
with the minutest directions, in the hands of his
lawyer. If he had wished to be more popular after
his death than he had been in his lifetime, he could
not have hit upon any better plan to conciliate in a
lump the approbation of his neighbours than that
of providing for what undertakers call &ldquo;a first-class
funeral.&rdquo; The good custom of honouring the departed,
and committing their bodies to the earth with
care and respect, was carried, in our old-fashioned
neighbourhood, to a point at which what began in
<!-- Page 29 -->reverence ended in what was barely decent, and what
was meant to be most melancholy became absolutely
comical. But a sense of the congruous and the incongruous
was not cultivated amongst us, whereas
solid value (in size, quantity and expense) was perhaps
over-estimated. So our furniture, our festivities, and
our funerals bore witness.</p>

<p>No one had ever seen the old miser&rsquo;s furniture,
and he gave no festivities; but he made up for it in
his funeral.</p>

<p>Children, like other uneducated classes, enjoy
domestic details, and going over the ins and outs of
other people&rsquo;s affairs behind their backs; especially
when the interest is heightened by a touch of gloom,
or perfected by the addition of some personal importance
in the matter. Jem and I were always fond
of funerals, but this funeral, and the fuss that it made
in the parish, we were never likely to forget.</p>

<p>Even our own household was so demoralized by
the grim gossip of the occasion that Jem and I were
accused of being unable to amuse ourselves, and of
listening to our elders. It was perhaps fortunate for
us that a favourite puppy died the day before the
funeral, and gave us the opportunity of burying him.</p>

<p class="center">
&ldquo;As if our whole vocation<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.1em;">Were endless imitation&mdash;&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p><!-- Page 30 -->Jem and I had already laid our gardens waste,
and built a rude wall of broken bricks round them to
make a churchyard; and I can clearly remember that
we had so far profited by what we had overheard
among our elders, that I had caught up some phrases
which I was rather proud of displaying, and that I
quite overawed Jem by the air with which I spoke
of &ldquo;the melancholy occasion&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;wishes of
deceased&rdquo;&mdash;and the &ldquo;feelings of survivors&rdquo; when we
buried the puppy.</p>

<p>It was understood that I could not attend the
puppy&rsquo;s funeral in my proper person, because I
wished to be the undertaker; but the happy thought
struck me of putting my wheelbarrow alongside of
the brick wall with a note inside it to the effect that
I had &ldquo;sent my carriage as a mark of respect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In one point we could not emulate the real
funeral: that was carried out &ldquo;regardless of expense.&rdquo;
The old miser had left a long list of the names of
the people who were to be invited to it and to its
attendant feast, in which was not only my father&rsquo;s
name, but Jem&rsquo;s and mine. Three yards was the
correct length of the black silk scarves which it was
the custom in the neighbourhood to send to dead
people&rsquo;s friends; but the old miser&rsquo;s funeral-scarves
were a whole yard longer, and of such stiffly ribbed
silk that Mr. Soot, the mourning draper, assured my
<!-- Page 31 -->mother that &ldquo;it would stand of itself.&rdquo; The black
gloves cost six shillings a pair, and the sponge-cakes,
which used to be sent with the gloves and scarves,
were on this occasion ornamented with weeping
willows in white sugar.</p>

<p>Jem and I enjoyed the cake, but the pride we felt
in our scarves and gloves was simply boundless.
What pleased us particularly was that our funeral
finery was not enclosed with my father&rsquo;s. Mr. Soot&rsquo;s
man delivered three separate envelopes at the door,
and they looked like letters from some bereaved giant.
The envelopes were twenty inches by fourteen, and
made of cartridge-paper; the black border was two
inches deep, and the black seals must have consumed
a stick of sealing-wax among them. They contained
the gloves and the scarves, which were lightly gathered
together in the middle with knots of black gauze
ribbon.</p>

<p>How exquisitely absurd Jem and I must have
looked with four yards of stiff black silk attached to
our little hats I can imagine, if I cannot clearly
remember. My dear mother dressed us and saw us
off (for, with some curious relic of pre-civilized notions,
women were not allowed to appear at funerals), and
I do not think she perceived anything odd in our
appearance. She was very gentle, and approved of
everything that was considered right by the people
<!-- Page 32 -->she was used to, and she had only two anxieties about
our scarves: first, that they should show the full four
yards of respect to the memory of the deceased;
and secondly, that we should keep them out of
the dust, so that they might &ldquo;come in useful
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She fretted a little because she had not thought
of changing our gloves for smaller sizes (they were
eight and a quarter); but my father &ldquo;pish&rdquo;ed and
&ldquo;pshaw&rdquo;ed, and said it was better than if they had
been too small, and that we should be sure to be late
if my mother went on fidgeting. So we pulled them
on&mdash;with ease&mdash;and picked up the tails of our hatbands&mdash;with
difficulty&mdash;and followed my father, our
hearts beating with pride, and my mother and the
maids watching us from the door. We arrived quite
half-an-hour earlier than we need have done, but
the lane was already crowded with complimentary
carriages, and curious bystanders, before whom we
held our heads and hatbands up; and the scent of
the wild roses was lost for that day in an all-pervading
atmosphere of black dye. We were very tired, I
remember, by the time that our turn came to be put
into a carriage by Mr. Soot, who murmured&mdash;&ldquo;Pocket-handkerchiefs,
gentlemen&rdquo;&mdash;and, following the example
of a very pale-faced stranger who was with us,
we drew out the clean handkerchiefs with which our
<!-- Page 33 -->mother had supplied us, and covered our faces with
them.</p>

<p>At least Jem says he shut <i>his</i> eyes tight, and kept
his face covered the whole way, but he always <i>was</i> so
conscientious! I held my handkerchief as well as I
could with my gloves; but I contrived to peep from
behind it, and to see the crowd that lined the road to
watch us as we wound slowly on.</p>

<p>If these outsiders, who only saw the procession
and the funeral, were moved almost to enthusiasm by
the miser&rsquo;s post-mortem liberality, it may be believed
that the guests who were bidden to the feast did not
fail to obey the ancient precept, and speak well of the
dead. The tables (they were rickety) literally groaned
under the weight of eatables and drinkables, and the
dinner was so prolonged that Jem and I got terribly
tired, in spite of the fun of watching the faces of the
men we did not know, to see which got the reddest.</p>

<p>My father wanted us to go home before the reading
of the will, which took place in the front parlour; but
the lawyer said, &ldquo;I think the young gentlemen should
remain,&rdquo; for which we were very much obliged to
him; though the pale-faced man said quite crossly&mdash;&ldquo;Is
there any special reason for crowding the room
with children, who are not even relatives of the
deceased?&rdquo; which made us feel so much ashamed
that I think we should have slipped out by ourselves;
<!-- Page 34 -->but the lawyer, who made no answer, pushed us gently
before him to the top of the room, which was soon
far too full to get out of by the door.</p>

<p>It was very damp and musty. In several places
the paper hung in great strips from the walls, and the
oddest part of all was that every article of furniture
in the room, and even the hearthrug, was covered
with sheets of newspaper pinned over to preserve it.
I sat in the corner of a sofa, where I could read the
trial of a man who murdered somebody twenty-five
years before, but I never got to the end of it, for it
went on behind a very fat man who sat next to me,
and he leaned back all the time and hid it. Jem sat
on a little footstool, and fell asleep with his head on
my knee, and did not wake till I nudged him, when
our names were read out in the will. Even then he
only half awoke, and the fat man drove his elbow into
me and hurt me dreadfully for whispering in Jem&rsquo;s
ear that the old miser had left us ten pounds apiece,
for having saved the life of his cat.</p>

<p>I do not think any of the strangers (they were
distant connections of the old man; he had no near
relations) had liked our being there; and the lawyer,
who was very kind, had had to tell them several times
over that we really had been invited to the funeral.
After our legacies were known about they were so
cross that we managed to scramble through the
<!-- Page 35 -->window, and wandered round the garden. As we sat
under the trees we could hear high words within, and
by and by all the men came out and talked in angry
groups about the will. For when all was said and
done, it appeared that the old miser had not left a
penny to any one of the funeral party but Jem and
me, and that he had left Walnut-tree Farm to a
certain Mrs. Wood, of whom nobody knew anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wording is so peculiar,&rdquo; the fat man said
to the pale-faced man and a third who had come out
with them; &ldquo;&lsquo;left to her as a sign of sympathy, if not
an act of reparation.&rsquo; He must have known whether
he owed her any reparation or not, if he were in his
senses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. If he were in his senses,&rdquo; said the third
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the money?&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; said
the pale-faced man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly, sir. That&rsquo;s what <i>I</i> say, too,&rdquo; said the
fat man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are only two fields, besides the house,&rdquo;
said the third. &ldquo;He must have had money, and the
lawyer knows of no investments of any kind, he
says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he has left it to his cat,&rdquo; he added,
looking very nastily at Jem and me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s oddly put, too,&rdquo; murmured the pale-faced
<!-- Page 36 -->relation. &ldquo;The two fields, the house and furniture,
and everything of every sort therein contained.&rdquo;
And the lawyer coming up at that moment, he went
slowly back into the house, looking about him as he
went, as if he had lost something.</p>

<p>As the lawyer approached, the fat man got very
red in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was as mad as a hatter, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
we shall dispute the will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you will be wrong,&rdquo; said the lawyer,
blandly. &ldquo;He was eccentric, my dear sir, very
eccentric; but eccentricity is not insanity, and you
will find that the will will stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jem and I were sitting on an old garden-seat, but
the men had talked without paying any attention to
us. At this moment Jem, who had left me a minute
or two before, came running back and said: &ldquo;Jack!
Do come and look in at the parlour window. That
man with the white face is peeping everywhere, and
under all the newspapers, and he&rsquo;s made himself so
dusty! It&rsquo;s such fun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Too happy at the prospect of anything in the
shape of fun, I followed Jem on tiptoe, and when we
stood by the open window with our hands over our
mouths to keep us from laughing, the pale-faced man
was just struggling with the inside lids of an old
japanned tea-caddy.</p>

<p><!-- Page 37 -->He did not see us, he was too busy, and he did
not hear us, for he was talking to himself, and we
heard him say, &ldquo;Everything of every sort therein
contained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I suppose the lawyer was right, and that the fat
man was convinced of it, for neither he nor any one
else disputed the old miser&rsquo;s will. Jem and I each
opened an account in the Savings Bank, and Mrs.
Wood came into possession of the place.</p>

<p>Public opinion went up and down a good deal
about the old miser still. When it leaked out that
he had worded the invitation to his funeral to the
effect that, being quite unable to tolerate the follies of
his fellow-creatures, and the antics and absurdities
which were necessary to entertain them, he had much
pleasure in welcoming his neighbours to a feast, at
which he could not reasonably be expected to preside&mdash;everybody
who heard it agreed that he must have
been mad.</p>

<p>But it was a long sentence to remember, and not
a very easy one to understand, and those who saw
the plumes and the procession, and those who had
a talk with the undertaker, and those who got a yard
more than usual of such very good black silk, and
those who were able to remember what they had had
for dinner, were all charitably inclined to believe that
the old man&rsquo;s heart had not been far from being in
<!-- Page 38 -->the right place, at whatever angle his head had been
set on.</p>

<p>And then by degrees curiosity moved to Mrs.
Wood. Who was she? What was she like? What
was she to the miser? Would she live at the farm?</p>

<p>To some of these questions the carrier, who was
the first to see her, replied. She was &ldquo;a quiet,
genteel-looking sort of a grey-haired widow lady, who
looked as if she&rsquo;d seen a deal of trouble, and was
badly off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The neighbourhood was not unkindly, and many
folk were ready to be civil to the widow if she came
to live there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she never will,&rdquo; everybody said. &ldquo;She
must let it. Perhaps the new doctor might think of
it at a low rent, he&rsquo;d be glad of the field for his horse.
What could she do with an old place like that, and
not a penny to keep it up with?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What she did do was to have a school there, and
that was how Walnut-tree Farm became Walnut-tree
Academy.</p>

&ldquo;What are little boys made of, made of?<br />
<span style="margin-left: -2.9em;">What are little boys made of?&rdquo;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;"><i>Nursery Rhyme</i>.</span><br />
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the school was opened, Jem and I were sent
there at once. Everybody said it was &ldquo;time we were
sent somewhere,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;we were getting too wild
for home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got so tired of hearing this at last, that one day
I was goaded to reply that &ldquo;home was getting too
tame for me.&rdquo; And Jem, who always backed me up,
said, &ldquo;And me too.&rdquo; For which piece of swagger
we forfeited our suppers; but when we went to bed
we found pieces of cake under our pillows, for my
mother could not bear us to be short of food, however
badly we behaved.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the trousers had anything
to do with it, but about the time that Jem and I
were put into trousers we lived in a chronic state of
behaving badly. What makes me feel particularly
ashamed in thinking of it is, that I know it was not
<!-- Page 40 -->that we came under the pressure of any overwhelming
temptations to misbehave and yielded through weakness,
but that, according to an expressive nursery
formula, we were &ldquo;seeing how naughty we could be.&rdquo;
I think we were genuinely anxious to see this undesirable
climax; in some measure as a matter of
experiment, to which all boys are prone, and in which
dangerous experiments, and experiments likely to be
followed by explosion, are naturally preferred. Partly,
too, from an irresistible impulse to &ldquo;raise a row,&rdquo;
and take one&rsquo;s luck of the results. This craving to
disturb the calm current of events, and the good
conduct and composure of one&rsquo;s neighbours as a
matter of diversion, must be incomprehensible by
phlegmatic people, who never feel it, whilst some
Irishmen, I fancy, never quite conquer it, perhaps
because they never quite cease to be boys. In any
degree I do not for an instant excuse it, and in excess
it must be simply intolerable by better-regulated
minds.</p>

<p>But really, boys who are pickles should be put into
jars with sound stoppers, like other pickles, and I
wonder that mothers and cooks do not get pots like
those that held the forty thieves, and do it.</p>

<p>I fancy it was because we happened to be in this
rough, defiant, mischievous mood, just about the
time that Mrs. Wood opened her school, that we did
<!-- Page 41 -->not particularly like our school-mistress. If I had
been fifteen years older, I should soon have got
beyond the first impression created by her severe
dress, close widow&rsquo;s cap and straight grey hair, and
have discovered that the outline of her face was
absolutely beautiful, and I might possibly have
detected, what most people failed to detect, that
an odd unpleasing effect, caused by the contrast
between her general style, and an occasional lightness
and rapidity and grace of movement in her
slender figure, came from the fact that she was much
younger than she looked and affected to be. The
impression I did receive of her appearance I communicated
to my mother in far from respectful
pantomime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, love, and what do you think of Mrs.
Wood?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; chanted I, in that high brassy pitch
of voice which Jem and I had adopted for this
bravado period of our existence&mdash;&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s like
our old white hen that turned up its eyes and died of
the pip. Lack-a-daisy-dee! Lack-a-daisy-dee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I twisted my body about, and strolled up
and down the room with a supposed travesty of
Mrs. Wood&rsquo;s movements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she is,&rdquo; said faithful Jem. &ldquo;Lack-a-daisy-dee!
Lack-a-daisy-dee!&rdquo; and he wriggled about
<!-- Page 42 -->after me, and knocked over the Berlin wool-basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear!&rdquo; said our poor mother.</p>

<p>Jem righted the basket, and I took a run and a
flying leap over it, and having cleared it successfully,
took another, and yet another, each one soothing my
feelings to the extent by which it shocked my mother&rsquo;s.
At the third bound, Jem, not to be behindhand,
uttered a piercing yell from behind the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried my
mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the war-whoop of the Objibeway Indians,&rdquo;
I promptly explained, and having emitted another,
to which I flattered myself Jem&rsquo;s had been as
nothing for hideousness, we departed in file to raise
a row in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Summer passed into autumn. Jem and I really
liked going to school, but it was against our principles
at that time to allow that we liked anything
that we ought to like.</p>

<p>Some sincere but mistaken efforts to improve our
principles were made, I remember, by a middle-aged
single lady, who had known my mother in her
girlhood, and who was visiting her at this unlucky
stage of our career. Having failed to cope with us
directly, she adopted the plan of talking improvingly
to our mother and at us, and very severe some of her
<!-- Page 43 -->remarks were, and I don&rsquo;t believe that Mother liked
them any better than we did.</p>

<p>The severest she ever made were I think
heightened in their severity by the idea that we
were paying unusual attention, as we sat on the
floor a little behind her one day. We were paying
a great deal of attention, but it was not so much
to Miss Martin as to a stock of wood-lice which I
had collected, and which I was arranging on the
carpet that Jem might see how they roll themselves
into smooth tight balls when you tease them. But
at last she talked so that we could not help attending.
I dared not say anything to her, but her own
tactics were available. I put the wood-lice back in
my pocket, and stretching my arms yawningly above
my head, I said to Jem, &ldquo;How dull it is! I wish
I were a bandit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jem generally outdid me if possible, from sheer
willingness and loyalty of spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> should like to be a burglar,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>And then we both left the room very quietly and
politely. But when we got outside I said, &ldquo;I hate
that woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Jem; &ldquo;she regularly hectors over
mother&mdash;I hate her worst for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I. Jem, doesn&rsquo;t she take pills?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;why?&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- Page 44 -->&ldquo;I believe she does; I&rsquo;m certain I saw a box on
her dressing-table. Jem, run like a good chap and
see, and if there is one, empty out the pills and bring
me the pill-box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jem obeyed, and I sat down on the stairs and
began to get the wood-lice out again. There were
twelve nice little black balls in my hand when Jem
came back with the pill-box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;but knock out all the
powder, it might smother them. Now, give it to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jem danced with delight when I put the wood-lice
in and put on the lid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope she&rsquo;ll shake the box before she opens it,&rdquo;
I said, as we replaced it on the dressing-table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope she will, or they won&rsquo;t be tight. Oh,
Jack! Jack! <i>How many do you suppose she takes at a
time?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>We never knew, and what is more, we never
knew what became of the wood-lice, for, for some
reason, she kept our counsel as well as her own about
the pill-box.</p>

<p>One thing that helped to reconcile us to spending
a good share of our summer days in Walnut-tree
Academy was that the school-mistress made us very
comfortable. Boys at our age are not very sensitive
about matters of taste and colour and so forth, but
<!-- Page 45 -->even we discovered that Mrs. Wood had that knack
of adapting rooms to their inhabitants, and making
them pleasant to the eye, which seems to be a trick
at the end of some people&rsquo;s fingers, and quite unlearnable
by others. When she had made the old
miser&rsquo;s rooms to her mind, we might have understood,
if we had speculated about it, how it was that she had
not profited by my mother&rsquo;s sound advice to send all
his &ldquo;rubbishy odds and ends&rdquo; (the irregularity and
ricketiness and dustiness of which made my mother
shudder) to be &ldquo;sold at the nearest auction-rooms,
and buy some good solid furniture of the cabinet-maker
who furnished for everybody in the neighbourhood,
which would be the cheapest in the long-run, besides
making the rooms look like other people&rsquo;s at last.&rdquo;
That she evaded similar recommendations of paperhangers
and upholsterers, and of wall-papers and
carpets, and curtains with patterns that would &ldquo;stand,&rdquo;
and wear best, and show dirt least, was a trifle in the
eyes of all good housekeepers, when our farming-man&rsquo;s
daughter brought the amazing news with her to Sunday
tea, that &ldquo;the missus&rdquo; had had in old Sally, and had
torn the paper off the parlour, and had made Sally
&ldquo;lime-wash the walls, for all the world as if it was a
cellar.&rdquo; Moreover, she had &ldquo;gone over&rdquo; the lower
part herself, and was now painting on the top of that.
There was nothing for it, after this news, but to sigh
<!-- Page 46 -->and conclude that there was something about the old
place which made everybody a little queer who came
to live in it.</p>

<p>But when Jem and I saw the parlour (which was
now the school-room), we decided that it &ldquo;looked very
nice,&rdquo; and was &ldquo;uncommonly comfortable.&rdquo; The
change was certainly amazing, and made the funeral
day seem longer ago than it really was. The walls
were not literally lime-washed; but (which is the same
thing, except for a little glue!) they were distempered,
a soft pale pea-green. About a yard deep above the
wainscot this was covered with a dark sombre green
tint, and along the upper edge of this, as a border all
round the room, the school-mistress had painted a
trailing wreath of white periwinkle. The border was
painted with the same materials as the walls, and with
very rapid touches. The white flowers were skilfully
relieved by the dark ground, and the varied tints of
the leaves, from the deep evergreen of the old ones to
the pale yellow of the young shoots, had demanded
no new colours, and were wonderfully life-like and
pretty. There was another border, right round the
top of the room; but that was painted on paper and
fastened on. It was a Bible text&mdash;&ldquo;Keep Innocency,
and take heed to the thing that is right, for that shall
bring a man Peace at the last.&rdquo; And Mrs. Wood had
done the text also.</p>

<p><!-- Page 47 -->There were no curtains to the broad, mullioned
window, which was kept wide open at every lattice;
and one long shoot of ivy that had pushed in farther
than the rest had been seized, and pinned to the wall
inside, where its growth was a subject of study and
calculation, during the many moments when we were
&ldquo;trying to see&rdquo; how little we could learn of our
lessons. The black-board stood on a polished easel;
but the low seats and desks were of plain pine like the
floor, and they were scrupulously scrubbed. The
cool tint of the walls was somewhat cheered by
coloured maps and prints, and the school-mistress&rsquo;s
chair (an old carved oak one that had been much
revived by bees-wax and turpentine since the miser&rsquo;s
days) stood on the left-hand side of the window&mdash;under
&ldquo;Keep Innocency,&rdquo; and looking towards
&ldquo;Peace at the last.&rdquo; I know, for when we were all
writing or something of that sort, so that she could sit
still, she used to sit with her hands folded and look
up at it, which was what made Jem and me think of
the old white hen that turned up its eyes; and made
Horace Simpson say that he believed she had done
one of the letters wrong, and could not help looking
at it to see if it showed. And by the school-mistress&rsquo;s
chair was the lame boy&rsquo;s sofa. It was the very old
sofa covered with newspapers on which I had read
about the murder, when the lawyer was reading the
<!-- Page 48 -->will. But she had taken off the paper, and covered
it with turkey red, and red cushions, and a quilt of
brown holland and red bordering, to hide his crumpled
legs, so that he looked quite comfortable.</p>

<p>I remember so well the first day that he came.
His father was a parson on the moors, and this boy
had always wanted to go to school in spite of his
infirmity, and at last his father brought him in a light
cart down from the moors, to look at it; and when
he got him out of the cart, he carried him in. He
was a big man, I remember, with grey hair and bent
shoulders, and a very old coat, for it split a little at
one of the seams as he was carrying him in, and we
laughed.</p>

<p>When they got into the room, he put the boy
down, keeping his arm round him, and wiped his
face and said&mdash;&ldquo;How deliciously cool!&rdquo;&mdash;and the
boy stared all round with his great eyes, and then he
lifted them to his father&rsquo;s face and said&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come
here. I do like it. But not to-day, my back is so
bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And what makes me know that Horace was
wrong, and that Mrs. Wood had made no mistake
about the letters of the text, is that &ldquo;Cripple Charlie&rdquo;&mdash;as
we called him&mdash;could see it so well with lying
down. And he told me one day that when his back
was very bad, and he got the fidgets and could not
<!-- Page 49 -->keep still, he used to fix his eyes on &ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; which
had gold round the letters, and shone, and that if he
could keep steadily to it, for a good bit, he always fell
asleep at the last. But he was very fanciful, poor
chap!</p>

<p>I do not think it was because Jem and I had any
real wish to become burglars that we made a raid on
the walnuts that autumn. I do not even think that
we cared very much about the walnuts themselves.</p>

<p>But when it is understood that the raid was to be
a raid by night, or rather in those very early hours of
the morning which real burglars are said almost to
prefer; that it was necessary to provide ourselves with
thick sticks; that we should have to force the hedge and
climb the trees; that the said trees grew directly under
the owner&rsquo;s bedroom window, which made the chances
of detection hazardously great; and that walnut juice
(as I have mentioned before) is of a peculiarly unaccommodating
nature, since it will neither disguise you
at the time nor wash off afterwards&mdash;it will be obvious
that the dangers and delights of the adventure were
sufficient to blunt, for the moment, our sense of the
fact that we were deliberately going a-thieving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we wear black masks?&rdquo; said Jem.</p>

<p>On the whole I said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; for I did not know
where we should get them, nor, if we did, how we
should keep them on.</p>

<p><!-- Page 50 -->&ldquo;If she has a blunderbuss, and fires,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;you must duck your head, remember; but if she
springs the rattle we must cut and run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will her blunderbuss be loaded, do you think?&rdquo;
asked Jem. &ldquo;Mother says the one in <i>their</i> room
isn&rsquo;t; she told me so on Saturday. But she says
we&rsquo;re never to touch it, all the same, for you never
can be sure about things of that sort going off. Do
you think Mrs. Wood&rsquo;s will be loaded?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and of course she might
load it if she thought she heard robbers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard father say that if you shoot a burglar
outside it&rsquo;s murder,&rdquo; said Jem, who seemed rather
troubled by the thought of the blunderbuss; &ldquo;but
if you shoot him inside it&rsquo;s self-defence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you may spring a rattle outside, anyway,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;and if hers makes as much noise as ours,
it&rsquo;ll be heard all the way here. So mind, if she begins,
you must jump down and cut home like mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armed with these instructions and our thick sticks,
Jem and I crept out of the house before the sun was
up or a bird awake. The air seemed cold after our
warm beds, and the dew was so drenching in the
hedge bottoms, and on the wayside weeds of our
favourite lane, that we were soaked to the knees
before we began to force the hedge. I did not think
that grass and wild-flowers could have held so much
<!-- Page 51 -->wet. By the time that we had crossed the orchard, and
I was preparing to grip the grandly scored trunk of the
nearest walnut-tree with my chilly legs, the heavy
peeling, the hard cracking, and the tedious picking of
a green walnut was as little pleasurable a notion as
I had in my brain.</p>

<p>All the same, I said (as firmly as my chattering
teeth would allow) that I was very glad we had come
when we did, for that there certainly were fewer
walnuts on the tree than there had been the day
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been at them,&rdquo; said I, almost indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pickling,&rdquo; responded Jem with gloomy conciseness;
and spurred by this discovery to fresh enthusiasm
for our exploit, we promptly planned
operations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up the tree,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and beat, and you
can pick them as they fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jem was, I fear, only too well accustomed to my
arrogating the first place in our joint undertakings,
and after giving me &ldquo;a leg up&rdquo; to an available bit of
foothold, and handing up my stick, he waited patiently
below to gather what I beat down.</p>

<p>The walnuts were few and far between, to say
nothing of leaves between, which in walnut-trees are
large. The morning twilight was dim, my hands were
cold and feebler than my resolution. I had battered
<!-- Page 52 -->down a lot of leaves and twigs, and two or three
walnuts; the sun had got up at last, but rather
slowly, as if he found the morning chillier than he
expected, and a few rays were darting here and there
across the lane, when Jem gave a warning &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
and I left off rustling in time to hear Mrs. Wood&rsquo;s
bedroom lattice opened, and to catch sight of something
pushed out into the morning mists.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; said the school-mistress.</p>

<p>Neither Jem nor I took upon us to inform her,
and we were both seized with anxiety to know what
was at the window. He was too low down and I too
much buried in foliage to see clearly. Was it the
rattle? I took a hasty step downwards at the thought.
Or was it the blunderbuss? In my sudden move I
slipped on the dew-damped branch, and cracked a
rotten one with my elbow, which made an appalling
crash in the early stillness, and sent a walnut&mdash;pop!
on to Jem&rsquo;s hat, who had already ducked to avoid
the fire of the blunderbuss, and now fell on his face
under the fullest conviction that he had been shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; said the school-mistress, and (my
tumble having brought me into a more exposed
position) she added, &ldquo;Is that you, Jack and
Jem?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; said I, ungrammatically but stoutly,
hoping that Jem at any rate would slip off.</p>

<p><!-- Page 53 -->But he had recovered himself and his loyalty, and
unhesitatingly announced, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; and was
picking the bits of grass off his cheeks and knees
when I got down beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you came to take my walnuts like
this,&rdquo; said the voice from above. She had a particularly
clear one, and we could hear it quite well. &ldquo;I
got a basketful on purpose for you yesterday afternoon.
If I let it down by a string, do you think you
can take it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Happily she did not wait for a reply, as we could
not have got a word out between us; but by and by
the basketful of walnuts was pushed through the
lattice and began to descend. It came slowly and
unsteadily, and we had abundant leisure to watch it,
and also, as we looked up, to discover what it was
that had so puzzled me in Mrs. Wood&rsquo;s appearance&mdash;that
when I first discovered that it was a head and
not a blunderbuss at the window I had not recognized
it for hers.</p>

<p>She was without her widow&rsquo;s cap, which revealed
the fact that her hair, though the two narrow, smooth
bands of it which appeared every day beyond her cap
were unmistakably grey, was different in some essential
respects from (say) Mrs. Jones&rsquo;s, our grey-haired
washer-woman. The more you saw of Mrs. Jones&rsquo;s
head, the less hair you perceived her to have, and the
<!-- Page 54 -->whiter that little appeared. Indeed, the knob into
which it was twisted at the back was much of the colour
as well as of the size of a tangled reel of dirty white
cotton. But Mrs. Wood&rsquo;s hair was far more abundant
than our mother&rsquo;s, and it was darker underneath than
on the top&mdash;a fact which was more obvious when the
knot into which it was gathered in her neck was no
longer hidden. Deep brown streaks were mingled
with the grey in the twists of this, and I could see
them quite well, for the outline of her head was dark
against the white-washed mullion of the window, and
framed by ivy-leaves. As she leaned out to lower
the basket we could see her better and better, and, as
it touched the ground, the jerk pulled her forward,
and the knot of her hair uncoiled and rolled heavily
over the window-sill.</p>

<p>By this time the rays of the sun were level with
the windows, and shone full upon Mrs. Wood&rsquo;s face.
I was very much absorbed in looking at her, but I
could not forget our peculiar position, and I had an
important question to put, which I did without more
ado.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, madam, shall you tell Father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We only want to know,&rdquo; added Jem.</p>

<p>She hesitated a minute, and then smiled. &ldquo;No;
I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll do it again;&rdquo; after which she
disappeared.</p>

<p><!-- Page 55 -->&ldquo;She&rsquo;s certainly no sneak,&rdquo; said I, with an effort
to be magnanimous, for I would much rather she had
sprung the rattle or fired the blunderbuss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I say,&rdquo; said Jem, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t she pretty without
her cap?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We looked ruefully at the walnuts. We had lost
all appetite for them, and they seemed disgustingly
damp, with their green coats reeking with black
bruises. But we could not have left the basket
behind, so we put our sticks through the handles, and
carried it like the Sunday picture of the spies carrying
the grapes of Eshcol.</p>

<p>And Jem and I have often since agreed that we
never in all our lives felt so mean as on that occasion,
and we sincerely hope that we never may.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is only in some books and some sermons
that people are divided into &ldquo;the wicked&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the good,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the wicked&rdquo; have no consciences
at all. Jem and I had wilfully gone thieving,
but we were far from being utterly hardened, and the
school-mistress&rsquo;s generosity weighed heavily upon ours.
Repentance and the desire to make atonement seem
to go pretty naturally together, and in my case they
led to the following dialogue with Jem, on the subject
of two exquisite little bantam hens and a cock, which
were our joint property, and which were known in the
farmyard as &ldquo;the Major and his wives.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- Page 56 -->These titles (which vexed my dear mother from
the first) had suggested themselves to us on this wise.
There was a certain little gentleman who came to our
church, a brewer by profession, and a major in the
militia by choice, who was so small and strutted so
much that to the insolent observation of boyhood he
was &ldquo;exactly like&rdquo; our new bantam cock. Young
people are very apt to overhear what is not intended
for their knowledge, and somehow or other we learned
that he was &ldquo;courting&rdquo; (as his third wife) a lady of
our parish. His former wives are buried in our
churchyard. Over the first he had raised an obelisk
of marble, so costly and affectionate that it had won
the hearts of his neighbours in general, and of his
second wife in particular. When she died the gossips
wondered whether the Major would add her name to
that of her predecessor, or &ldquo;go to the expense&rdquo; of a
new monument. He erected a second obelisk, and it
was taller than the first (height had a curious fascination
for him), and the inscription was more touching
than the other. This time the material was Aberdeen
granite, and as that is most difficult to cut, hard
to polish, and heavy to transport, the expense was
enormous. These two monstrosities of mortuary
pomp were the pride of the parish, and they were
familiarly known to us children (and to many other
people) as &ldquo;the Major&rsquo;s wives.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- Page 57 -->When we called the cock &ldquo;the Major,&rdquo; we
naturally called the hens &ldquo;the Major&rsquo;s wives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dears, I don&rsquo;t like that name at all,&rdquo; said
my mother. &ldquo;I never like jokes about people who
are dead. And for that matter, it really sounds as if
they were both alive, which is worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was during our naughty period, and I strutted
on my heels till I must have looked very like the
little brewer himself, and said, &ldquo;And why shouldn&rsquo;t
they both be alive? Fancy the Major with two wives,
one on each arm, and both as tall as the monuments!
What fun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I said the words &ldquo;one on each arm,&rdquo; I put up
first one and then the other of my own, and having
got a satisfactory impetus during the rest of my sentence,
I crossed the parlour as a catherine-wheel under
my mother&rsquo;s nose. It was a new accomplishment, of
which I was very proud, and poor Jem somewhat
envious. He was clumsy and could not manage it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; ejaculated my mother, &ldquo;Jack, I must
speak to your father about those dangerous tricks of
yours. And it quite shocks me to hear you talk in
that light way about wicked things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jem was to my rescue in a moment, driving his
hands into the pockets of his blouse, and turning
them up to see how soon he might hope that his
fingers would burst through the lining.</p>

<p><!-- Page 58 -->&ldquo;Jacob had two wives,&rdquo; he said; and he chanted
on, quoting imperfectly from Dr. Watts&rsquo;s <i>Scripture
Catechism</i>, &ldquo;And Jacob was a good man, therefore
his brother hated him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Jem,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that was Abel. Jacob
was Isaac&rsquo;s younger son, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! Hush! Hush!&rdquo; said my mother.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to do Sunday lessons on week-days.
What terrible boys you are!&rdquo; And, avoiding to fight
about Jacob&rsquo;s wives with Jem, who was pertinacious
and said very odd things, my mother did what women
often do and are often wise in doing&mdash;she laid down
her weapons and began to beseech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darlings, call your nice little hens some other
names. Poor old mother doesn&rsquo;t like those.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was melted in an instant, and began to cast
about in my head for new titles. But Jem was softly
obstinate, and he had inherited some of my mother&rsquo;s
wheedling ways. He took his hands from his pockets,
flung his arms recklessly round her clean collar, and
began stroking (or <i>pooring</i>, as we called it) her head
with his grubby paws. And as he <i>poored</i> he coaxed&mdash;&ldquo;Dear
nice old mammy! It&rsquo;s only us. What can
it matter? Do let us call our bantams what we like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And my mother gave in before I had time to.</p>

<p>The dialogue I held with Jem about the bantams
after the walnut raid was as follows:</p>

<p><!-- Page 59 -->&ldquo;Jem, you&rsquo;re awfully fond of the &lsquo;Major and his
wives,&rsquo; I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; said Jem, &ldquo;<i>I am</i>. But I don&rsquo;t mind,
Jack, if you want them for your very own. I&rsquo;ll give
up my share,&rdquo;&mdash;and he sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw such a good chap as you are, Jem.
But it&rsquo;s not that. I thought we might give them to
Mrs. Wood. It was so beastly about those disgusting
walnuts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t touch walnut pickle now,&rdquo; said Jem,
feelingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d be a very handsome present,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They took a prize at the Agricultural,&rdquo; said Jem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know she likes eggs. She beats &rsquo;em into a
froth and feeds Charlie with &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I could eat walnut pickle again if I knew
she had the bantams,&rdquo; sighed Jem, who was really
devoted to the little cock-major and the auburn-feathered
hens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em this afternoon,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>We did so&mdash;in a basket, Eshcol-grape wise, like
the walnuts. When we told Mother, she made no
objection. She would have given her own head off
her shoulders if, by ill-luck, any passer-by had thought
of asking for it. Besides, it solved the difficulty of
the objectionable names.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wood was very loth to take our bantams,
<!-- Page 60 -->but of course Jem and I were not going to recall a
gift, so she took them at last, and I think she was very
much pleased with them.</p>

<p>She had got her cap on again, tied under her chin,
and nothing to be seen of her hair but the very grey
piece in front. It made her look so different that I
could not keep my eyes off her whilst she was talking,
though I knew quite well how rude it is to stare.
And my head got so full of it that I said at last, in
spite of myself, &ldquo;Please, madam, why is it that part
of your hair is grey and part of it dark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face got rather red, she did not answer for a
minute; and Jem, to my great relief, changed the
subject, by saying, &ldquo;We were very much obliged to
you for not telling Father about the walnuts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wood leaned back against the high carving
of her old chair and smiled, and said very slowly,
&ldquo;Would he have been very angry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d have flogged us, I expect,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I expect,&rdquo; continued Jem, &ldquo;that he&rsquo;d have
said to us what he said to Bob Furniss when he took
the filberts: &lsquo;If you begin by stealing nuts, you&rsquo;ll end
by being transported.&rsquo; Do you think Jack and I shall
end by being transported?&rdquo; added Jem, who had a
merciless talent for applying general principles to
individual cases.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wood made no reply, neither did she move,
<!-- Page 61 -->but her eyelids fell, and then her eyes looked far
worse than if they had been shut, for there was a
little bit open, with nothing but white to be seen.
She was still rather red, and she did not visibly
breathe. I have no idea for how many seconds I had
gazed stupidly at her, when Jem gasped, &ldquo;Is she
dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I became terror-struck, and crying, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
find Mary Anne!&rdquo; fled into the kitchen, closely
followed by Jem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s took with them fits occasional,&rdquo; said Mary
Anne, and depositing a dripping tin she ran to the
parlour. We followed in time to see her stooping
over the chair and speaking very loudly in the school-mistress&rsquo;s
ear,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay ye down, ma&rsquo;am, shall I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But still the widow was silent, on which Mary
Anne took her up in her brawny arms, and laid her
on &ldquo;Cripple Charlie&rsquo;s&rdquo; sofa, and covered her with
the quilt.</p>

<p>We settled the Major and his wives into their new
abode, and then hurried home to my mother, who put
on her bonnet, and took a bottle of something, and
went off to the farm.</p>

<p>She did not come back till tea-time, and then she
was full of poor Mrs. Wood. &ldquo;Most curious attacks,&rdquo;
she explained to my father; &ldquo;she can neither move
<!-- Page 62 -->nor speak, and yet she hears everything, though she
doesn&rsquo;t always remember afterwards. She said she
thought it was &lsquo;trouble,&rsquo; poor soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brought this one on?&rdquo; said my father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out,&rdquo; said my mother. &ldquo;I hope
you boys did nothing to frighten her, eh? Are you
sure you didn&rsquo;t do one of those dreadful wheels,
Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This I indignantly denied, and Jem supported me.</p>

<p>My mother&rsquo;s sympathy had been so deeply enlisted,
and her report was so detailed, that Jem and I
became bored at last, besides resenting the notion
that we had been to blame. I gave one look into the
strawberry jam pot, and finding it empty, said my
grace and added, &ldquo;Women are a poor lot, always
turning up their eyes and having fits about nothing.
I know one thing, nobody &rsquo;ll ever catch <i>me</i> being
bothered with a wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor me neither,&rdquo; said Jem.</p>

</p>


<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">You</span> know what an Apiary is, Isaac, of course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was sitting in the bee-master&rsquo;s cottage, opposite
to him, in an arm-chair, which was the counterpart of
his own, both of them having circular backs, diamond-shaped
seats, and chintz cushions with frills. It was
the summer following that in which Jem and I had
tried to see how badly we could behave; this uncivilized
phase had abated: Jem used to ride about a
great deal with my father, and I had become intimate
with Isaac Irvine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what an Apiary is, Isaac?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An A-P-I-A-R-Y.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure, sir, to be sure,&rdquo; said Isaac. &ldquo;An
<!-- Page 64 --><i>appyary</i>&rdquo; (so he was pleased to pronounce it), &ldquo;I
should be familiar with the name, sir, from my bee-book,
but I never calls my own stock anything but the
beehives. <i>Beehives</i> is a good, straightforward sort of a
name, sir, and it serves my turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you see we haven&rsquo;t come to the B&rsquo;s yet,&rdquo;
said I, alluding to what I was thinking of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does your father think of keeping &rsquo;em, sir?&rdquo;
said Isaac, alluding to what he was thinking of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he means to have them bound, I believe,&rdquo;
was my reply.</p>

<p>The bee-master now betrayed his bewilderment,
and we had a hearty laugh when we discovered that
he had been talking about bees whilst I had been
talking about the weekly numbers of the <i>Penny
Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>, which had not as yet reached the
letter B, but in which I had found an article on
Master Isaac&rsquo;s craft, under the word Apiary, which
had greatly interested me, and ought, I thought, to be
interesting to the bee-keeper. Still thinking of this I
said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you ever take your bees away from home,
Isaac?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re on the moors now, sir,&rdquo; said Isaac.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Are</i> they?&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re like the
Egyptians, and like the French, and the Piedmontese;
only you didn&rsquo;t take them in a barge.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- Page 65 -->&ldquo;Why, no, sir. The canal don&rsquo;t go nigh-hand of
the moors at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Egyptians,&rdquo; said I, leaning back into the
capacious arms of my chair, and epitomizing what I
had read, &ldquo;who live in Lower Egypt put all their
beehives into boats and take them on the river to
Upper Egypt. Right up at that end of the Nile the
flowers come out earliest, and the bees get all the
good out of them there, and then the boats are moved
lower down to where the same kind of flowers are
only just beginning to blossom, and the bees get all
the good out of them there, and so on, and on, and
on, till they&rsquo;ve travelled right through Egypt, with
all the hives piled up, and come back in the boats
to where they started from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And every hive a mighty different weight to
what it was when they did start, I&rsquo;ll warrant,&rdquo; said
Master Isaac enthusiastically. &ldquo;Did you find all that
in those penny numbers, Master Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and oh, lots more, Isaac! About lots of
things and lots of countries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scholarship&rsquo;s a fine thing,&rdquo; said the bee-master,
&ldquo;and seeing foreign parts is a fine thing, and many&rsquo;s
the time I&rsquo;ve wished for both. I suppose that&rsquo;s the
same Egypt that&rsquo;s in the Bible, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and the same river Nile that
Moses was put on in the ark of bulrushes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- Page 66 -->&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no countries I&rsquo;d like to see better than
them Bible countries,&rdquo; said Master Isaac, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve
wished it more ever since that gentleman was here
that gave that lecture in the school, with the Holy
Land magic-lantern. He&rsquo;d been there himself, and
he explained all the slides. They were grand, some
of &rsquo;em, when you got &rsquo;em straight and steady for a
bit. They&rsquo;re an awkward thing to manage, is slides,
sir, and the school-master he wasn&rsquo;t much good at &rsquo;em,
he said, and that young scoundrel Bob Furniss and
another lad got in a hole below the platform and
pulled the sheet. But when you did get &rsquo;em, right
side up, and the light as it should be, they <i>were</i>
grand! There was one they called the Wailing Place
of the Jews, with every stone standing out as fair as
the flags on this floor. John Binder, the mason, was
at my elbow when that came on, and he clapped his
hands, and says he, &lsquo;Well, yon beats all!&rsquo; But the
one for my choice, sir, was the Garden of Gethsemane
by moonlight. I&rsquo;d only gone to the penny places, for
I&rsquo;m a good size and can look over most folks&rsquo; heads,
but I thought I must see that a bit nearer, cost what
it might. So I found a shilling, and I says to the
young fellow at the door (it was the pupil-teacher), &lsquo;I
must go a bit nearer to yon.&rsquo; And he says, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
not going into the reserved seats, Isaac?&rsquo; So I says,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t put yourself about, my lad, I shan&rsquo;t interfere
<!-- Page 67 -->with the quality; but if half a day&rsquo;s wage &rsquo;ll bring me
nearer to the Garden of Gethsemane, I&rsquo;m bound to
go.&rsquo; And I went. I didn&rsquo;t intrude myself on nobody,
though one gentleman was for making room for me at
once, and twice over he offered me a seat beside him.
But I knew my manners, and I said, &lsquo;Thank you, sir,
I can see as I stand.&rsquo; And I did see right well, and
kicked Bob Furniss too, which was good for all
parties. But I&rsquo;d like to see the very places themselves,
Master Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So should I,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but I should like to go
farther, all round the world, I think. Do you know,
Isaac, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe what curious beasts there
are in other countries, and what wonderful people and
places! Why, we&rsquo;ve only got to ATH&mdash;No. 135&mdash;now;
it leaves off at <i>Athanagilde</i>, a captain of the
Spanish Goths&mdash;he&rsquo;s nobody, but there are <i>such</i> apes
in that number! The Mono&mdash;there&rsquo;s a picture of
him, just like a man with a tail and horrid feet, who
used to sit with the negro women when they were at
work, and play with bits of paper; and a Quata, who
used to be sent to the tavern for wine, and when the
children pelted him he put down the wine and threw
stones at them. And there are pictures in all the
numbers, of birds and ant-eaters and antelopes, and I
don&rsquo;t know what. The Mono and the Quata live in the
West Indies, I think. You see, I think the A&rsquo;s are
<!-- Page 68 -->rather good numbers; very likely, for there&rsquo;s America,
and Asia, and Africa, and Arabia, and Abyssinia, and
there&rsquo;ll be Australia before we come to the B&rsquo;s. Oh,
Isaac! I do wish I could go round the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sighed, and the bee-master sighed also, with a
profundity that made his chair creak, well-seasoned as
it was. Then he said, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll say this, Master Jack,
next to going to such places the reading about &rsquo;em
must come. A penny a week&rsquo;s a penny a week to a
poor man, but I reckon I shall have to make shift to
take in those numbers myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Isaac did not take them in, however, for I used to
take ours down to his cottage, and read them aloud
to him instead. He liked this much better than if he
had had to read to himself&mdash;he said he could understand
reading better when he heard it than when he
saw it. For my own part I enjoyed it very much, and
I fancy I read rather well, it being a point on which
Mrs. Wood expended much trouble with us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Isaac,&rdquo; said I on my next visit; &ldquo;this is
what I meant about the barge&rdquo;&mdash;and resting the
Penny Number on the arm of my chair, I read aloud
to the attentive bee-master&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Goldsmith describes
from his own observation a kind of floating apiary in
some parts of France and Piedmont. They have on
board of one barge, he says, threescore or a hundred
beehives&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- Page 69 -->&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an appy-ary if ye like, sir!&rdquo; ejaculated
Master Isaac, interrupting his pipe and me to make
way for the observation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody saw &lsquo;a convoy of <i>four thousand</i>
hives&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; on the Nile,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>The bee-master gave a resigned sigh. &ldquo;Go on,
Master Jack,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&mdash;well defended from the inclemency of an
accidental storm,&rsquo;&rdquo; I proceeded; &ldquo;&lsquo;and with these
the owners float quietly down the stream; one beehive
yields the proprietor a considerable income.
Why, he adds, a method similar to this has never
been adopted in England, where we have more gentle
rivers and more flowery banks than in any other part
of the world, I know not; certainly it might be turned
to advantage, and yield the possessor a secure, though
perhaps a moderate, income.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was very fond of the canal which ran near us
(and was, for that matter, a parish boundary): and
the barges, with their cargoes, were always interesting
to me; but a bargeful of bees seemed something quite
out of the common. I thought I should rather like to
float down a gentle river between flowery banks, surrounded
by beehives on which I could rely to furnish
me with a secure though moderate income; and I
said so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So should I, sir,&rdquo; said the bee-master. &ldquo;And I
<!-- Page 70 -->should uncommon like to ha&rsquo; seen the one beehive
that brought in a considerable income. Honey must
have been very dear in those parts, Master Jack.
However, it&rsquo;s in the book, so I suppose it&rsquo;s right
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made no defence of the veracity of the <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>,
for I was thinking of something else, of which,
after a few moments, I spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isaac, you don&rsquo;t stay with your bees on the
moors. Do you ever go to see them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure I do, Master Jack, nigh every
Sunday through the season. I start after I get back
from morning church, and I come home in the dark,
or by moonlight. My missus goes to church in the
afternoons, and for that bit she locks up the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish you&rsquo;d take me the next time!&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure I will, and too glad sir, if you&rsquo;re
allowed to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That <i>was</i> the difficulty, and I knew it. No one
who has not lived in a household of old-fashioned
middle-class country folk of our type has any notion
how difficult it is for anybody to do anything unusual
therein. In such a well-fitted but unelastic establishment
the dinner-hour, the carriage horses, hot water,
bedtime, candles, the post, the wash-day, and an extra
blanket, from being the ministers of one&rsquo;s comfort,
<!-- Page 71 -->become the stern arbiters of one&rsquo;s fate. Spring cleaning&mdash;which
is something like what it would be to
build, paint, and furnish a house, and to &ldquo;do it at
home&rdquo;&mdash;takes place as naturally as the season it
celebrates; but if you want the front door kept open
after the usual hour for drawing the bolts and hanging
the robbers&rsquo; bell, it&rsquo;s odds if the master of the
house has not an apoplectic fit, and if servants of
twelve and fourteen years&rsquo; standing do not give
warning.</p>

<p>And what is difficult on week-days is on Sundays
next door to impossible, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>But one&rsquo;s parents, though they have their little
ways like other people, are, as a rule&mdash;oh, my heart!
made sadder and wiser by the world&rsquo;s rough experiences,
bear witness!&mdash;very indulgent; and after a
good many ups and downs, and some compromising
and coaxing, I got my way.</p>

<p>On one point my mother was firm, and I feared
this would be an insuperable difficulty. I must go
twice to church, as our Sunday custom was&mdash;a custom
which she saw no good reason for me to break. It is
easy to smile at her punctiliousness on this score; but
after all these years, and on the whole, I think she
was right. An unexpected compromise came to my
rescue, however: Isaac Irvine&rsquo;s bees were in the
parish of Cripple Charlie&rsquo;s father, within a stone&rsquo;s
<!-- Page 72 -->throw (by the bee-master&rsquo;s strong arm) of the church
itself, which was a small minster among the moors.
Here I promised faithfully to attend Evening Prayer,
for which we should be in time; and I started, by
Isaac Irvine&rsquo;s side, on my first real &ldquo;expedition&rdquo; on
the first Sunday in August, with my mother&rsquo;s blessing
and a threepenny-bit with a hole in it, &ldquo;in case of a
collection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We dined before we started, I with the rest, and
Isaac in our kitchen; but I had no great appetite&mdash;I
was too much excited&mdash;and I willingly accepted some
large sandwiches made with thick slices of home-made
bread and liberal layers of home-made potted
meat, &ldquo;in case I should feel hungry&rdquo; before I got
there.</p>

<p>It pains me to think how distressed my mother
was because I insisted on carrying the sandwiches in a
red and orange spotted handkerchief, which I had
purchased with my own pocket-money, and to which
I was deeply attached, partly from the bombastic
nature of the pattern, and partly because it was big
enough for any grown-up man. &ldquo;It made me look
like a tramping sailor,&rdquo; she said. I did not tell her
that this was precisely the effect at which I aimed,
though it was the case; but I coaxed her into permitting
it, and I abstained from passing a certain
knowing little ash stick through the knot, and hoisting
<!-- Page 73 -->the bundle over my left shoulder, till I was well out of
the grounds.</p>

<p>My efforts to spare her feelings on this point,
however, proved vain. She ran to the landing-window
to watch me out of sight, and had a full view
of my figure as I swaggered with a business-like gait
by Isaac&rsquo;s side up the first long hill, having set my hat
on the back of my head with an affectation of profuse
heat, my right hand in the bee-master&rsquo;s coat-pocket for
support, and my left holding the stick and bundle at
an angle as showy and sailor-like as I could assume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll just meet the Ebenezer folk coming
out of chapel, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; said our housemaid over my
mother&rsquo;s shoulder, by way of consolation.</p>

<p>Our journey was up-hill, for which I was quite
prepared. The blue and purple outline of the moors
formed the horizon line visible from our gardens,
whose mistiness or clearness was prophetic of the
coming weather, and over which the wind was supposed
to blow with uncommon &ldquo;healthfulness.&rdquo; I
had been there once to blow away the whooping-cough,
and I could remember that the sandy road
wound up and up, but I did not appreciate till that
Sunday how tiring a steady ascent of nearly five miles
may be.</p>

<p>We were within sight of the church and within
hearing of the bells, when we reached a wayside
<!-- Page 74 -->trough, whose brimming measure was for ever overflowed
by as bright a rill as ever trickled down a
hill-side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the first peal,&rdquo; said Master Isaac,
seating himself on the sandy bank, and wiping his
brows.</p>

<p>My well-accustomed ears confirmed his statement.
The bells moved too slowly for either the second or
the third peal, and we had twenty minutes at our
disposal.</p>

<p>It was then that I knew (for the first but not the
last time) what refreshment for the weary a spotted
handkerchief may hold. The bee-master and I
divided the sandwiches, and washed them down with
handfuls of the running rill, so fresh, so cold, so
limpid, that (like the saints and martyrs of a faith) it
would convert any one to water-drinking who did not
reflect on the commoner and less shining streams
which come to us through lead pipes and in evil communication
with sewers.</p>

<p>We were cool and tidy by the time that the little
&ldquo;Tom Tinkler&rdquo; bell began to &ldquo;hurry up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said I, checked at
the churchyard gate by an instinct of some hesitation
on Isaac&rsquo;s part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I am, sir,&rdquo; said the bee-master,
and in he came.</p>

<p><!-- Page 75 -->The thick walls, the stained windows, and the
stone floor, which was below the level of the churchyard,
made the church very cool. Master Isaac and
I seated ourselves so that we had a good view within,
and could also catch a peep through the open porch
of the sunlit country outside. Charlie&rsquo;s father was in
his place when we got in; his threadbare coat was
covered by the white linen of his office, and I do not
think it would have been possible even to my levity to
have felt anything but a respectful awe of him in
church.</p>

<p>The cares of this life are not as a rule improving
to the countenance. No one who watches faces can
have failed to observe that more beauty is marred and
youth curtailed by vulgar worry than by almost any
other disfigurement. In the less educated classes,
where self-control is not very habitual, and where
interests beyond petty and personal ones are rare, the
soft brows and tender lips of girlhood are too often
puckered and hardened by mean anxieties, even where
these do not affect the girls personally, but only imitatively,
and as the daily interests of their station in
life. In such cases the discontented, careworn look
is by no means a certain indication of corresponding
suffering, but there are too many others in which
tempers that should have been generous, and faces
that should have been noble, and aims that should
<!-- Page 76 -->have been high, are blurred and blunted by the real
weight of real everyday care.</p>

<p>There are yet others; in which the spirit is too
strong for mortal accidents to pull it down&mdash;minds
that the narrowest career cannot vulgarize&mdash;faces to
which care but adds a look of pathos&mdash;souls which
keep their aims and faiths apart from the fluctuations
of &ldquo;the things that are seen.&rdquo; The personal influence
of natures of this type is generally very large, and it
was very large in the case of Cripple Charlie&rsquo;s father,
and made him a sort of Prophet, Priest, and King
over a rough and scattered population, with whom
the shy, scholarly poor gentleman had not otherwise
much in common.</p>

<p>It was his personal influence, I am sure, which
made the congregation so devout! There is one
rule which, I believe, applies to all congregations,
of every denomination, and any kind of ritual, and
that is, that the enthusiasm of the congregation is
in direct proportion to the enthusiasm of the minister;
not merely to his personal worth, nor even to his
popularity, for people who rather dislike a clergyman,
and disapprove of his service, will say a louder Amen
at his giving of thanks if his own feelings have a
touch of fire, than they would to that of a more
perfunctory parson whom they liked better. As is
the heartiness of the priest, so is the heartiness of the
<!-- Page 77 -->people&mdash;with such strictness that one is disposed
almost to credit some of it to actual magnetism.
<i>Response</i> is no empty word in public worship.</p>

<p>It was no empty word on this occasion. From
the ancient clerk (who kept a life-interest in what
were now the duties of a choir) to some gaping farm-lads
at my back, everybody said and sang to the
utmost of his ability. I may add that Isaac and I
involuntarily displayed a zeal which was in excess of
our Sunday customs; and if my tongue moved glibly
enough with the choir, the bee-master found many an
elderly parishioner besides himself and the clerk who
&ldquo;took&rdquo; both prayer and praise at such independent
paces as suited their individual scholarship, spectacles,
and notions of reverence.</p>

<p>It crowned my satisfaction when I found that
there was to be a collection. The hymn to which
the churchwardens moved about, gathering the pence,
whose numbers and noisiness seemed in keeping with
the rest of the service, was a well-known one to us
all. It was the favourite evening hymn of the district.
I knew every syllable of it, for Jem and I always sang
hymns (and invariably this one) with my dear mother,
on Sunday evening after supper. When we were
good, we liked it, and, picking one favourite after
another, we often sang nearly through the hymn-book.
When we were naughty, we displayed a good deal of
<!-- Page 78 -->skill in making derisive faces behind my mother&rsquo;s
back, as she sat at the piano, without betraying ourselves,
and in getting our tongues out and in again
during the natural pauses and convolutions of the
tune. But these occasional fits of boyish profanity
did not hinder me from having an equally boyish
fund of reverence and enthusiasm at the bottom of
my heart, and it was with proud and pleasurable
emotions that I heard the old clerk give forth the
familiar first lines,</p>

<p class="center">
&ldquo;Soon shall the evening star with silver ray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.6em;">Shed its mild lustre o&rsquo;er this sacred day,&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>and got my threepenny-bit ready between my finger
and thumb.</p>

<p>Away went the organ, which was played by the
vicar&rsquo;s eldest daughter&mdash;away went the vicar&rsquo;s second
daughter, who &ldquo;led the singing&rdquo; from the vicarage
pew with a voice like a bird&mdash;away went the choir,
which, in spite of surplices, could not be cured of
waiting half a beat for her&mdash;and away went the
congregation&mdash;young men and maidens, old men and
children&mdash;in one broad tide of somewhat irregular
harmony. Isaac did not know the words as well as
I did, so I lent him my hymn-book; one result of
which was, that the print being small, and the sense
of a hymn being in his view a far more important
<!-- Page 79 -->matter than the sound of it, he preached rather than
sang&mdash;in an unequal cadence which was perturbing to
my more musical ear&mdash;the familiar lines,</p>

<p>During the next verse my devotions were a little
distracted by the gradual approach of a churchwarden
for my threepenny-bit, which was hot with three
verses of expectant fingering. Then, to my relief,
he took it, and the bee-master&rsquo;s contribution, and I
felt calmer, and listened to the little prelude which it
was always the custom for the organist to play before
the final verse of a hymn. It was also the custom to
sing the last verse as loudly as possible, though this
is by no means invariably appropriate. It fitted the
present occasion fairly enough. From where I stood
I could see the bellows-blower (the magnetic current
of enthusiasm flowed even to the back of the organ)
nerve himself to prodigious pumping&mdash;Charlie&rsquo;s sister
drew out all the stops&mdash;the vicar passed from the
prayer-desk to the pulpit with the rapt look of a man
who walks in a prophetic dream&mdash;we pulled ourselves
together, Master Isaac brought the hymn book close
to his glasses, and when the tantalizing prelude was
past we burst forth with a volume which merged all
<!-- Page 80 -->discrepancies. As far as I am able to judge of my
own performance, I fear I <i>bawled</i> (I&rsquo;m sure the boy
behind me did),</p>

<p class="center">
<span style="margin-left: -3.2em;">&ldquo;Father of Heaven, in Whom our hopes confide,</span><br />

</p>

<p>The sermon was short, and when the service was
over Master Isaac and I spent a delightful afternoon
with his bees among the heather. The &ldquo;evening
star&rdquo; had come out when we had some tea in the
village inn, and we walked home by moonlight.
There was neither wind nor sun, but the air was
almost oppressively pure. The moonshine had taken
the colour out of the sandy road and the heather, and
had painted black shadows by every boulder, and
most things looked asleep except the rill that went on
running. Only we and the rabbits, and the night
moths and the beetles, seemed to be stirring. An
occasional bat appeared and vanished like a spectral
illusion, and I saw one owl flap across the moor with
level wings against the moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I <i>have</i> enjoyed it!&rdquo; was all I could say
when I parted from the bee-master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so have I, Master Jack,&rdquo; was his reply, and
he hesitated as if he had something more to say, and
then he said it. &ldquo;I never enjoyed it as much, and
<!-- Page 81 -->you can thank your mother, sir, with old Isaac&rsquo;s duty,
for sending us to church. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know
why I never went before when I was up yonder, for
I always took notice of the bells. I reckon I thought
I hadn&rsquo;t time, but you can say, with my respects, sir,
that please <span class="smcap">God</span> I shan&rsquo;t miss again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I believe he never did; and Cripple Charlie&rsquo;s
father came to look on him as half a parishioner.</p>

<p>I was glad I had not shirked Evening Prayer
myself, though (my sex and age considered) it was
not to be expected that I should comfort my mother&rsquo;s
heart by confessing as much. Let me confess it now,
and confess also that if it was the first time, it was
not the last that I have had cause to realize&mdash;oh
women, for our sakes remember it!&mdash;into what light
and gentle hands <span class="smcap">God</span> lays the reins that guide men&rsquo;s
better selves.</p>

<hr />

<p>The most remarkable event of the day happened
at the end of it. Whilst Isaac was feeling the weight
of one of his hives, and just after I lost chase of a
very peculiar-looking beetle, from his squeezing himself
away from me under a boulder, I had caught sight
of a bit of white heather, and then bethought me
of gathering a nosegay (to include this rarity) of moor
flowers and grasses for Mrs. Wood. So when we
reached the lane on our way home, I bade Isaac
<!-- Page 82 -->good-night, and said I would just run in by the back
way into the farm (we never called it the Academy)
and leave the flowers, that the school-mistress might
put them in water. Mary Anne was in the kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mrs. Wood?&rdquo; said I, when she had got
over that silly squeak women always give when you
come suddenly on them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear, Master Jack! what a turn you did
give me! I thought it was the tramp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What tramp?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, a great lanky man that came skulking
here a bit since, and asked for the missus. She
was down the garden, and I&rsquo;ve half a notion he
went after her. I wish you&rsquo;d go and look for her,
Master Jack, and fetch her in. It&rsquo;s as damp as
dear knows what, and she takes no more care of
herself than a baby. And I&rsquo;d be glad to know that
man was off the place. There&rsquo;s wall-fruit and lots
of things about, a low fellow like that might pick up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My ears felt a little hot at this allusion to low
fellows and garden thieving, and I hurried off to do
Mary Anne&rsquo;s bidding without further parley. There
was a cloud over the moon as I ran down the back
garden, but when I was nearly at the end the moon
burst forth again, so that I could see. And this is
what I saw:&mdash;</p>

<p>First, a white thing lying on the ground, and it
<!-- Page 83 -->was the widow&rsquo;s cap, and then Mrs. Wood herself,
with a gaunt lanky-looking man, such as Mary
Anne had described. Her head came nearly to his
shoulder, as I was well able to judge, for he was
holding it in his hands and had laid his own upon
it, as if it were a natural resting-place. And his hair
coming against the darker part of hers, I could see
that his was grey all over. Up to this point I had
been too much stupefied to move, and I had just
become conscious that I ought to go, when the white
cap lying in the moonlight seemed to catch his eye
as it had caught mine; and he set his heel on it
with a vehemence that made me anxious to be off.
I could not resist one look back as I left the garden,
if only to make sure that I had not been dreaming.
No, they were there still, and he was lifting the coil
of her hair, which I suppose had come down when
the cap was pulled off, and it took the full stretch
of his arm to do so, before it fell heavily from his
fingers.</p>

<p>When I presented myself to my mother with the
bunch of flowers still in my hand, she said, &ldquo;Did my
Jack get these for Mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook my head. &ldquo;No, Mother. For Mrs.
Wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might have called at the farm as you
passed,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p><!-- Page 84 -->&ldquo;I did!&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you see Mrs. Wood, love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I saw her, but she&rsquo;d got the tramp with
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What tramp?&rdquo; asked my mother in a horror-struck
voice, which seemed quite natural to me,
for I had been brought up to rank tramps in the
same &ldquo;dangerous class&rdquo; with mad dogs, stray bulls,
drunken men, and other things which it is undesirable
to meet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The great lanky one,&rdquo; I explained, quoting from
Mary Anne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was he doing with Mrs. Wood?&rdquo; asked
my mother anxiously.</p>

<p>I had not yet recovered from my own bewilderment,
and was reckless of the shock inflicted by my
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Pooring</i> her head, and kissing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> even the miser&rsquo;s funeral had produced in the
neighbourhood anything like the excitement which
followed that Sunday evening. At first my mother&mdash;her
mind filled by the simplest form of the problem,
namely, that Mrs. Wood was in the hands of a tramp&mdash;wished
my father to take the blunderbuss in his
hand and step down to the farm. He had &ldquo;pish&rdquo;ed
and &ldquo;pshaw&rdquo;ed about the blunderbuss, and was
beginning to say more, when I was dismissed to bed,
where I wandered back over the moors in uneasy
dreams, and woke with the horror of a tramp&rsquo;s hand
upon my shoulder. After suffering the terrors of
night for some time, and finding myself no braver
with my head under the bedclothes than above them,
I began conscientiously to try my mother&rsquo;s family
recipe for &ldquo;bad dreams and being afraid in the
<!-- Page 86 -->dark.&rdquo; This was to &ldquo;say over&rdquo; the Benedicite
correctly, which (if by a rare chance one were still
awake at the end) was to be followed by a succession
of the hymns one knew by heart. It required an
effort to <i>begin</i>, and to <i>really try</i>, but the children of
such mothers as ours are taught to make efforts, and
once fairly started, and holding on as a duty, it
certainly did tend to divert the mind from burglars
and ghosts, to get the beasts, creeping things, and
fowls of the air into their right places in the chorus
of benedictions. That Jem never could discriminate
between the &ldquo;Dews and Frosts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Frost and
Cold&rdquo; verses needs no telling. I have often finished
and still been frightened and had to fall back upon
the hymns, but this night I began to dream pleasanter
dreams of Charlie&rsquo;s father and the bee-master before
I got to the holy and humble men of heart.</p>

<p>I slept long then, and Mother would not let me
be awakened. When I did open my eyes Jem was sitting
at the end of the bed, dying to tell me the news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack! you have waked, haven&rsquo;t you? I see
your eyes. Don&rsquo;t shut &rsquo;em again. What <i>do</i> you
think? <i>Mrs. Wood&rsquo;s husband has come home!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I never knew the ins and outs of the story very
exactly. At the time that what did become generally
known was fresh in people&rsquo;s minds Jem and I were
not by way of being admitted to &ldquo;grown-up&rdquo; con<!-- Page 87 -->versations;
and though Mrs. Wood&rsquo;s husband and
I became intimate friends, I neither wished nor
dared to ask him more about his past than he chose
to tell, for I knew enough to know that it must be
a most intolerable pain to recall it.</p>

<p>What we had all heard of the story was this. Mr.
Wood had been a head clerk in a house of business.
A great forgery was committed against his employers,
and he was accused. He was tried, condemned, and
sentenced to fourteen years&rsquo; penal servitude, which,
in those days, meant transportation abroad. For
some little time the jury had not been unanimous.
One man doubted the prisoner&rsquo;s guilt&mdash;the man we
afterwards knew as the old miser of Walnut-tree
Farm. But he was over-persuaded at last, and Mr.
Wood was convicted and sentenced. He had spent
ten years of his penal servitude in Bermuda when
a man lying in Maidstone Jail under sentence of
death for murder, confessed (amongst other crimes
of which he disburdened his conscience) that it was
he, and not the man who had been condemned, who
had committed the forgery. Investigation confirmed
the truth of this statement, and Mr. Wood was
&ldquo;pardoned&rdquo; and brought home.</p>

<p>He had just come. He was the tramp.</p>

<p>In this life the old miser never knew that his first
judgment had been the just one, but the doubt
<!-- Page 88 -->which seems always to have haunted him&mdash;whether
he had not helped to condemn the innocent&mdash;was
the reason of his bequest to the convict&rsquo;s wife, and
explained much of the mysterious wording of the
will.</p>

<p>It was a tragic tale, and gave a terrible interest
to the gaunt, white-haired, shattered-looking man
who was the hero of it. It had one point of special
awe for me, and I used to watch him in church
and think of it, till I am ashamed to say that I
forgot even when to stand up and sit down. He
had served ten years of his sentence. Ten years!
Ten times three hundred and sixty-five days! All
the days of the years of my life. The weight of
that undeserved punishment had fallen on him the
year that I was born, and all that long, long time
of home with Mother and Father and Jem&mdash;all the
haymaking summers and snowballing winters&mdash;whilst
Jem and I had never been away from home, and
had had so much fun, and nothing very horrid that
I could call to mind except the mumps&mdash;he had
been an exile working in chains. I remember
rousing up with a start from the realization of this
one Sunday to find myself still standing in the
middle of the Litany. My mother was behaving
too well herself to find me out, and though Jem
was giggling he dared not move, because he was
<!-- Page 89 -->kneeling next my father, whose back was turned
to me. I knelt down, and started to hear the
parson say&mdash;&ldquo;show Thy pity upon all prisoners and
captives!&rdquo; And then I knew what it is to wish
when it is too late. For I did so wish I had really
prayed for prisoners and captives every Sunday,
because then I should have prayed for that poor
man nearly all the long time he had been so
miserable; for we began to go to church very early,
and one learns to pray easier and sooner than one
learns anything else.</p>

<p>All this had happened in the holidays, but when
they were over school opened as before, and with
additional scholars; for sympathy was wide and
warm with the school-mistress. Strangely enough,
both partners in the firm which had prosecuted
Mr. Wood were dead. Their successors offered him
employment, but he could not face the old associations.
I believe he found it so hard to face any one,
that this was the reason of his staying at home for
a time and helping in the school. I don&rsquo;t think we
boys made him uncomfortable as grown-up strangers
seemed to do, and he was particularly fond of
Cripple Charlie.</p>

<p>This brought me into contact with him, for
Charlie and I were great friends. He was as well
pleased to be read to out of the Penny Numbers as
<!-- Page 90 -->the bee-master, and he was interested in things of
which Isaac Irvine was completely ignorant.</p>

<p>Our school was a day-school, but Charlie had
been received by Mrs. Wood as a boarder. His
poor back could not have borne to be jolted to and
from the moors every day. So he lived at Walnut-tree
Farm, and now and then his father would come
down in a light cart, lent by one of the parishioners,
and take Charlie home from Saturday to Monday, and
then bring him back again.</p>

<p>The sisters came to see him too, by turns, sometimes
walking and sometimes riding a rough-coated
pony, who was well content to be tied to a gate,
and eat some of the grass that overgrew the lane.
And often Charlie came to <i>us</i>, especially in haytime,
for haycocks seem very comfortable (for people
whose backs hurt) to lean against; and we could
cover his legs with hay too, as he liked them to be
hidden. There is no need to say how tender my
mother was to him, and my father used to look at
him half puzzledly and half pitifully, and always
spoke to him in quite a different tone of voice to
the one he used with other boys.</p>

<p>Jem gave Charlie the best puppy out of the curly
brown spaniel lot; but he didn&rsquo;t really like being
with him, though he was sorry for him, and he could
not bear seeing his poor legs.</p>

<p><!-- Page 91 -->&ldquo;They make me feel horrid,&rdquo; Jem said. &ldquo;And
even when they&rsquo;re covered up, I know they&rsquo;re there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a chip of the old block, Jem,&rdquo; said my
father, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a guinea to a hospital any day
sooner than see a patient. I&rsquo;m as sorry as can be
for the poor lad, but he turns me queer, though I
feel ashamed of it. I like things <i>sound</i>. Your
mother&rsquo;s different; she likes &rsquo;em better for being sick
and sorry, and I suppose Jack takes after her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My father was wrong about me. Pity for Charlie
was not half of the tie between us. When he was
talking, or listening to the penny numbers, I never
thought about his legs or his back, and I don&rsquo;t now
understand how anybody could.</p>

<p>He read and remembered far more than I did,
and he was even wilder about strange countries.
He had as adventurous a spirit as any lad in the
school, cramped up as it was in that misshapen
body. I knew he&rsquo;d have liked to go round the
world as well as I, and he often laughed and said&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s
more, Jack, if I&rsquo;d the money I would.
People are very kind to poor wretches like me all
over the world. I should never want a helping
hand, and the only difference between us would be,
that I should be carried on board ship by some
kind-hearted blue-jacket, and you&rsquo;d have to scramble
for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- Page 92 -->He was very anxious to know Isaac Irvine, and
when I brought the bee-master to see him, they
seemed to hold friendly converse with their looks
even before either of them spoke. It was a bad
day with Charlie, but he set his lips against the
pain, and raised himself on one arm to stare out of
his big brown eyes at the old man, who met them
with as steady a gaze out of his. Then Charlie
lowered himself again, and said in a tone of voice
by which I knew he was pleased, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad
you&rsquo;ve come to see me, old Isaac. It&rsquo;s very kind
of you. Jack says you know a lot about live things,
and that you like the numbers we like in the <i>Penny
Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>. I wanted to see you, for I think you
and I are much in the same boat; you&rsquo;re old, and
I&rsquo;m crippled, and we&rsquo;re both too poor to travel.
But Jack&rsquo;s to go, and when he&rsquo;s gone, you and I&rsquo;ll
follow him on the map.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> willing, sir,&rdquo; said the bee-master; and
when he said that, I knew how sorry he felt for
poor Charlie, for when he was moved he always
said very short things, and generally something
religious.</p>

<p>And for all Charlie&rsquo;s whims and fancies, and in
all his pain and fretfulness, and through fits of
silence and sensitiveness, he had never a better
friend than Isaac Irvine. Indeed the bee-master
<!-- Page 93 -->was one of those men (to be found in all ranks)
whose delicate tenderness might not be guessed
from the size and roughness of the outer man.</p>

<p>Our neighbours were all very kind to Mr. Wood,
in their own way, but they were a little impatient of
his slowness to be sociable, and had, I think, a sort
of feeling that the ex-convict ought not only to enjoy
evening parties more than other people, but to be just
a little more grateful for being invited.</p>

<p>However, one must have a strong and sensitive
imagination to cultivate wide sympathies when one
lives a quiet, methodical life in the place where one&rsquo;s
father and grandfather lived out quiet methodical
lives before one; and I do not think we were an
imaginative race.</p>

<p>The school-master (as we used to call him) had
seen and suffered so much more of life than we, that
I do not think he resented the clumsiness of our
sympathy; but now I look back I fancy that he must
have felt as if he wanted years of peace and quiet in
which to try and forget the years of suffering. Old
Isaac said one day, &ldquo;I reckon the master feels as if
he wanted to sit down and say to hisself over and
over again, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a free man, I&rsquo;m a free man, I&rsquo;m a
free man,&rsquo; till he can fair trust himself to believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Isaac was probably right, and perhaps evening
parties, though they are meant for treats, are not the
<!-- Page 94 -->best places to sit down and feel free in, particularly
when there are a lot of strange people who have heard
a dreadful story about you, and want to see what you
look like after it.</p>

<p>During the summer holidays Jem and I were out
the whole day long. When we came in I was ready
for the Penny Numbers, but Jem always fell asleep,
even if he did not go to bed at once. My father did
just the same. I think their feeling about houses was
of a perfectly primitive kind. They looked upon
them as comfortable shelter for sleeping and eating,
but not at all as places in which to pursue any occupation.
Life, for them, was lived out-of-doors.</p>

<p>I know now how dull this must have made the
evenings for my mother, and that it was very selfish
of me to wait till my father was asleep (for fear he
should say &ldquo;no&rdquo;), and then to ask her leave to take
the Penny Numbers down to the farm and sit with
Cripple Charlie.</p>

<p>Now and then she would go too, and chat with
Mrs. Wood, whilst the school-master and I were
turning the terrestrial globe by Charlie&rsquo;s sofa; but
as a rule Charlie and I were alone, and the Woods
went round the homestead together, and came home
hand in hand, through the garden, and we laughed to
think how we had taken him for a tramp.</p>

<p>And sometimes on a summer&rsquo;s evening, when we
<!-- Page 95 -->talked and read aloud to each other across a quaint
oak table that had been the miser&rsquo;s, of far-away lands
and strange birds of gorgeous plumage, the school-master
sat silent in the arm-chair by the open lattice,
resting his white head against the mullion that the ivy
was creeping up, and listened to the blackbirds and
thrushes as their songs dropped by odd notes into
silence, and gazed at the near fields and trees, and
the little homestead with its hayricks on the hill, when
the grass was apple-green in the gold mist of sunset:
and went on gazing when that had faded into fog, and
the hedgerow elms were black against the sky, as if
the eye could not be filled with seeing, nor the ear
with hearing!</p>

</p>


<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Jack</span>,&rdquo; said Charlie, &ldquo;listen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was reading bits out of the numbers to me,
whilst I was rigging a miniature yacht to sail on the
dam; and Mrs. Wood&rsquo;s husband was making a plan
of something at another table, and occasionally giving
me advice about my masts and sails. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the
South American forests,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;&lsquo;There every
tree has a character of its own; each has its peculiar
foliage, and probably also a tint unlike that of the
trees which surround it. Gigantic vegetables of the
most different families intermix their branches; five-leaved
bignonias grow by the side of bonduc-trees;
cassias shed their yellow blossoms upon the rich
fronds of arborescent ferns; myrtles and eugenias,
with their thousand arms, contrast with the elegant
simplicity of palms; and among the airy foliage of the
<!-- Page 97 -->mimosa the ceropia elevates its giant leaves and heavy
candelabra-shaped branches. Of some trees the trunk
is perfectly smooth, of others it is defended by
enormous spines, and the whole are often apparently
sustained by the slanting stems of a huge wild fig-tree.
With us, the oak, the chestnut, and the beech seem
as if they bore no flowers, so small are they and so
little distinguishable except by naturalists; but in the
forests of South America it is often the most gigantic
trees that produce the most brilliant flowers; cassias
hang down their pendants of golden blossoms, vochisias
unfold their singular bunches; corollas, longer
than those of our foxglove, sometimes yellow or sometimes
purple, load the arborescent bignonias; while
the chorisias are covered, as it were, with lilies, only
their colours are richer and more varied; grasses also
appear in form of bamboos, as the most graceful of
trees; bauhinias, bignonias, and aroideous plants
cling round the trees like enormous cables; orchideous
plants and bromelias overrun their limbs, or fasten
themselves to them when prostrated by the storm,
and make even their dead remains become verdant
with leaves and flowers not their own.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though he could read very well, Charlie had, so
far, rather stumbled through the long names in this
description, but he finished off with fluency, not to
say enthusiasm. &ldquo;&lsquo;Such are the ancient forests,
<!-- Page 98 -->flourishing in a damp and fertile soil, and clothed
with perpetual green.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was half-way through a profound sigh when I
caught the school-master&rsquo;s eye, who had paused in his
plan-making and was listening with his head upon his
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a groan!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds so splendid!&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
so afraid I shall never see it. I told Father last night
I should like to be a sailor, but he only said &lsquo;Stuff
and nonsense,&rsquo; and that there was a better berth
waiting for me in Uncle Henry&rsquo;s office than any of
the Queen&rsquo;s ships would provide for me; and Mother
begged me never to talk of it any more, if I didn&rsquo;t
want to break her heart&rdquo;&mdash;and I sighed again.</p>

<p>The school-master had a long smooth face, which
looked longer from melancholy, and he turned it and
his arms over the back of the chair, and looked at me
with the watchful listening look his eyes always had;
but I am not sure if he was really paying much
attention to me, for he talked (as he often did) as if
he were talking to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to be a soldier,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and my
father wouldn&rsquo;t let me. I often used to wish I had
run away and enlisted, when I was with Quarter-master
McCulloch, of the Engineers (he&rsquo;d risen
<!-- Page 99 -->from the ranks and was younger than me), in
Bermuda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bermuda! That&rsquo;s not very far from South
America, is it?&rdquo; said I, looking across to the big map
of the world. &ldquo;Is it very beautiful, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The school-master&rsquo;s eyes contracted as if he were
short-sighted, or looking at something inside his own
head. But he smiled as he answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poet says,</p>

<p class="center">
<span style="margin-left: -3.6em;">&lsquo;A pleasing land of drowsy-head it is,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0em;">Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -1.5em;">And of gay castles in the clouds that pass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -2.1em;">For ever flushing round a summer sky.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;But are there any curious beasts and plants and
that sort of thing?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe there were no native animals originally,&rdquo;
said the school-master. &ldquo;I mean inland ones. But
the fowls of the air and the fishes of the sea are of all
lovely forms and colours. And such corals and
sponges, and sea-anemones, blooming like flowers in
the transparent pools of the warm blue water that
washes the coral reefs and fills the little creeks and
bays!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I gasped&mdash;and he went on. &ldquo;The commonest
trees, I think, are palms and cedars. Lots of the old
houses were built of cedar, and I&rsquo;ve heard of old
cedar furniture to be picked up here and there, as
<!-- Page 100 -->some people buy old oak out of English farm-houses.
It is very durable and deliriously scented. People
used to make cedar bonfires when the small-pox was
about, to keep away infection. The gardens will
grow anything, and plots of land are divided by
oleander hedges of many colours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;h!&rdquo; ejaculated I, in long-drawn notes of
admiration. The school-master&rsquo;s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not only,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;do very gaudy
lobsters and quaint cray-fish and crabs with lanky
legs dispute your attention on the shore with the
shell-fish of the loveliest hues; there is no lack of
remarkable creatures indoors. Monstrous spiders,
whose bite is very unpleasant, drop from the roof;
tarantulas and scorpions get into your boots, and
cockroaches, hideous to behold and disgusting to
smell, invade every place from your bed to your store-cupboard.
If you possess anything, from food and
clothing to books and boxes, the ants will find it and
devour it, and if you possess a garden the mosquitoes
will find you and devour you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;h!&rdquo; I exclaimed once more, but this time
in a different tone.</p>

<p>Mr. Wood laughed heartily. &ldquo;Tropical loveliness
has its drawbacks, Jack. Perhaps some day when
your clothes are moulded, and your brain feels mouldy
too with damp heat, and you can neither work in the
<!-- Page 101 -->sun nor be at peace in the shade, you may wish
you were sitting on a stool in your uncle&rsquo;s office,
undisturbed by venomous insects, and cool in a
November fog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed too, but I shook my head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I shan&rsquo;t mind the insects if I can get
there. Charlie, were those wonderful ants old Isaac
said you&rsquo;d been reading about, Bermuda ants?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not catch Charlie&rsquo;s muttered reply, and when
I looked round I saw that his face was buried in the
red cushions, and that he was (what Jem used to call)
&ldquo;in one of his tempers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t exactly know how it was. I don&rsquo;t think
Charlie was jealous or really cross, but he used to
take fits of fancying he was in the way, and out of
it all (from being a cripple), if we seemed to be very
busy without him, especially about such things as planning
adventures. I knew what was the matter directly,
but I&rsquo;m afraid my consolation was rather clumsy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross, Charlie,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I thought
you were listening too, and if it&rsquo;s because you think
you won&rsquo;t be able to go, I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s really
a bit more chance of my going, though my legs <i>are</i>
all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about me,&rdquo; said Charlie; &ldquo;but
I wish you&rsquo;d put these numbers down, they&rsquo;re in my
way.&rdquo; And he turned pettishly over.</p>

<p><!-- Page 102 -->Before I could move, the school-master had taken
the papers, and was standing over Charlie&rsquo;s couch,
with his right hand against the wall, at the level of
his head, and his left arm hanging by his side; and
I suppose it was his attitude which made me notice,
before he began to speak, what a splendid figure he
had, and how strong he looked. He spoke in an
odd, abrupt sort of voice, very different from the way
he had been talking to me, but he looked down at
Charlie so intensely, that I think he felt it through
the cushions, and lifted his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When your father has been bringing you down
here, or at any time when you have been out amongst
other people, have you ever overheard them saying,
&lsquo;Poor chap! it&rsquo;s a sad thing,&rsquo; and things of that kind,
as if they were sorry for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cripple Charlie&rsquo;s face flushed scarlet, and my own
cheeks burned, as I looked daggers at the school-master,
for what seemed a brutal insensibility to the
lame boy&rsquo;s feelings. He did not condescend, however,
to meet my eyes. His own were still fixed
steadily on Charlie&rsquo;s, and he went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ve heard it.</i> My ears are quick, and for many
a Sunday after I came I caught the whispers behind
me as I went up the aisle, &lsquo;Poor man!&rsquo; &lsquo;Poor
gentleman!&rsquo; &lsquo;He looks bad, too!&rsquo; One morning
an old woman, in a big black bonnet, said, &lsquo;Poor
<!-- Page 103 -->soul!&rsquo; so close to me, that I looked down, and met
her withered eyes, full of tears&mdash;for me!&mdash;and I said,
&lsquo;Thank you, mother,&rsquo; and she fingered the sleeve of
my coat with her trembling hand (the veins were
standing out on it like ropes), and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve knowed
trouble myself, my dear. The Lord bless yours
to you!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been Betty Johnson,&rdquo; I interpolated;
but the school-master did not even look
at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and I,&rdquo; he said, bending nearer to Cripple
Charlie, &ldquo;have had our share of this life&rsquo;s pain so
dealt out to us that any one can see and pity us. My
boy, take a fellow-sufferer&rsquo;s word for it, it is wise and
good not to shrink from the seeing and pitying. The
weight of the cross spreads itself and becomes lighter
if one learns to suffer with others as well as with
oneself, to take pity and to give it. And as one
learns to be pained with the pains of others, one
learns to be happy in their happiness and comforted
by their sympathy, and then no man&rsquo;s life can be
quite empty of pleasure. I don&rsquo;t know if my troubles
have been lighter or heavier ones than yours&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The school-master stopped short, and turned his
head so that his face was almost hidden against his
hand upon the wall. Charlie&rsquo;s big eyes were full of
tears, and I am sure I distinctly felt my ears poke
<!-- Page 104 -->forwards on my head with anxious curiosity to catch
what Mr. Wood would tell us about that dreadful
time of which he had never spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was your age,&rdquo; he said bluntly, &ldquo;I was
unusually lithe and active and strong for mine. When
I was half as old again, I was stronger than any man
I knew, and had many a boyish triumph out of my
strength, because I was slender and graceful, and
this concealed my powers. I had all the energies
and ambitions natural to unusual vigour and manly
skill. I wanted to be a soldier, but it was not to
be, and I spent my youth at a desk in a house of
business. I adapted myself, but none the less I
chafed whenever I heard of manly exploits, and of
the delights and dangers that came of seeing the
world. I used to think I could bear anything to
cross the seas and see foreign climes. I did cross
the Atlantic at last&mdash;a convict in a convict ship (<span class="smcap">God</span>
help any man who knows what that is!), and I spent
the ten best years of my manhood at the hulks working
in chains. You&rsquo;ve never lost freedom, my lad,
so you have never felt what it is not to be able to
believe you&rsquo;ve got it back. You don&rsquo;t know what
it is to turn nervous at the responsibility of being
your own master for a whole day, or to wake in a
dainty room, with the birds singing at the open
window, and to shut your eyes quickly and pray to
<!-- Page 105 -->go on dreaming a bit, because you feel sure you&rsquo;re
really in your hammock in the hulks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The school-master lifted his other hand above
his head, and pressed both on it, as if he were in
pain. What Charlie was doing I don&rsquo;t know, but I
felt so miserable I could not help crying, and had to
hunt for my pocket-handkerchief under the table. It
was full of acorns, and by the time I had emptied it
and dried my eyes, Mr. Wood was lifting Charlie in
his arms, and arranging his cushions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; Charlie said, as he leant back;
&ldquo;how comfortable you have made me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been sick-nurse, amongst other trades.
For some months I was a hospital warder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Charlie began, and then he
stopped short, and said, &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; it was when I was a convict,&rdquo; said the
school-master. &ldquo;No offence, my boy. If I preach
I must try to practise. Jack&rsquo;s eyes are dropping out
of his head to hear more of Bermuda, and you and
I will put our whims and moods on one side, and
we&rsquo;ll all tell travellers&rsquo; tales together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cripple Charlie kept on saying &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and
I know he was very sorry not to be able to think
of anything more to say, for he told me so. He
wanted to have thanked him better, because he knew
that Mr. Wood had talked about his having been a
<!-- Page 106 -->convict, when he did not like to talk about it, just to
show Charlie that he knew what pain, and not being
able to do what you want, feel like, and that Charlie
ought not to fancy he was neglected.</p>

<p>And that was the beginning of all the stories
the school-master used to tell us, and of the natural
history lessons he gave us, and of his teaching me to
stuff birds, and do all kinds of things.</p>

<p>We used to say to him, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re better than the
Penny Numbers, for you&rsquo;re quite as interesting, and
we&rsquo;re sure you&rsquo;re true.&rdquo; And the odd thing was that
he made Charlie much more contented, because he
started him with so many collections, whilst he made
me only more and more anxious to see the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lane was full of colour that autumn, the first
autumn of the convict&rsquo;s return. The leaves turned
early, and fell late, and made the hedges gayer than
when the dog-roses were out; for not only were the
leaves of all kinds brighter than many flowers, but
the berries (from the holly and mountain-ash to the
hips and haws) were so thick-set, and so red and
shining, that, as my dear mother said, &ldquo;they looked
almost artificial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remember it well, because of two things. First,
that Jem got five of the largest hips we had ever
seen off a leafless dog-rose branch which stuck far
out of the hedge, and picked the little green coronets
off, so that they were smooth and glossy, and egg-shaped,
and crimson on one side and yellow on the
other; and then he got an empty chaffinch&rsquo;s nest
close by and put the five hips into it, and took it
<!-- Page 108 -->home, and persuaded Alice our new parlourmaid that
it was a robin redbreast&rsquo;s nest with eggs in it. And
she believed it, for she came from London and knew
no better.</p>

<p>The second thing I remember that autumn by, is
that everybody expected a hard winter because of the
berries being so fine, and the hard winter never came,
and the birds ate worms and grubs and left most of
the hedge fruits where they were.</p>

<p>November was bright and mild, and the morning
frosts only made the berries all the glossier when the
sun came out. We had one or two snow-storms in
December, and then we all said, &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;
but the snow melted away and left no bones behind.
In January the snow lay longer, and left big bones on
the moors, and Jem and I made a slide to school on
the pack track, and towards the end of the month
the mill-dam froze hard, and we had slides fifteen
yards long, and skating; and Winter seemed to have
come back in good earnest to fetch his bones away.</p>

<p>Jem was great fun in frosty weather; Charlie and
I used to die of laughing at him. I think cold made
him pugnacious; he seemed always ready for a row,
and was constantly in one. The January frost came
in our Christmas holidays, so Jem had lots of time
on his hands; he spent almost all of it out of doors,
and he devoted a good deal of it to fighting with the
<!-- Page 109 -->rough lads of the village. There was a standing
subject of quarrel, which is a great thing for either
tribes or individuals who have a turn that way. A
pond at the corner of the lower paddock was fed by
a stream which also fed the mill-dam; and the mill-dam
was close by, though, as it happened, not on my
father&rsquo;s property. Old custom made the mill-dam the
winter resort of all the village sliders and skaters, and
my father displayed a good deal of toleration when
those who could not find room for a new slide, or
wished to practise their &ldquo;outer edge&rdquo; in a quiet spot,
came climbing over the wall (there was no real
thoroughfare) and invaded our pond.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is because gratitude is a fatiguing
virtue, or perhaps it is because self-esteem has no
practical limits, that favours are seldom regarded
as such for long. They are either depreciated, or
claimed as rights; very often both. And what is
common in all classes is almost universal amongst
the uneducated. You have only to make a system
of giving your cast-off clothes to some shivering
family, and you will not have to wait long for an
eloquent essay on their shabbiness, or for an outburst
of sincere indignation if you venture to reserve a
warm jacket for a needy relative. Prescriptive rights,
in short, grow faster than pumpkins, which is amongst
the many warnings life affords us to be just as well as
<!-- Page 110 -->generous. Thence it had come about that the young
roughs of the village regarded our pond to all winter
intents and purposes as theirs, and my father as only
so far and so objectionably concerned in the matter
that he gave John Binder a yearly job in patching up
the wall which it took them three months&rsquo; trouble to
kick a breach in.</p>

<p>Our neighbours were what is called &ldquo;very independent&rdquo;
folk. In the grown-up people this was
modified by the fact that no one who has to earn his
own livelihood can be quite independent of other
people; if he would live he must let live, and throw a
little civility into the bargain. But boys of an age
when their parents found meals and hobnailed boots
for them whether they behaved well or ill, were able
to display independence in its roughest form. And
when the boys of our neighbourhood were rough, they
were very rough indeed.</p>

<p>The village boys had their Christmas holidays
about the same time that we had ours, which left
them as much spare time for sliding and skating as
we had, but they had their dinner at twelve o&rsquo;clock,
whilst we had ours at one, so that any young roughs
who wished to damage our pond were just comfortably
beginning their mischief as Jem and I were
saying grace before meat, and the thought of it took
away our appetites again and again.</p>

<p><!-- Page 111 -->That winter they were particularly aggravating.
The December frost was a very imperfect one, and
the mill-dam never bore properly, so the boys swarmed
over our pond, which was shallow and safe. Very
few of them could even hobble on skates, and those
few carried the art no farther than by cutting up the
slides. But thaw came on, so that there was no
sliding, and then the young roughs amused themselves
with stamping holes in the soft ice with their hobnailed
heels. When word came to us that they were
taking the stones off our wall and pitching them down
on to the soft ice below, to act as skaters&rsquo; stumbling-blocks
for the rest of that hard winter which we
expected, Jem&rsquo;s indignation was not greater than
mine. My father was not at home, and indeed, when
we had complained before, he rather snubbed us,
and said that we could not want the whole of the
pond to ourselves, and that he had always lived
quietly with his neighbours and we must learn to do
the same, and so forth. No action at all calculated
to assuage our thirst for revenge was likely to be
taken by him, so Jem and I held a council by Charlie&rsquo;s
sofa, and it was a council of war. At the end we all
three solemnly shook hands, and Charlie was left to
write and despatch brief notes of summons to our
more distant school-mates, whilst Jem and I tucked
up our trousers, wound our comforters sternly round
<!-- Page 112 -->our throats, and went forth in different directions to
gather the rest.</p>

<p>(Having lately been reading about the Highlanders,
who used to send round a fiery cross when
the clans were called to battle, I should have liked to
do so in this instance; but as some of the Academy
boys were no greater readers than Jem, they might
not have known what it meant, so we abandoned the
notion.)</p>

<p>There was not an Academy boy worth speaking
of who was in time for dinner the following day; and
several of them brought brothers or cousins to the
fray. By half-past twelve we had crept down the field
that was on the other side of our wall, and had hidden
ourselves in various corners of a cattle-shed, where a
big cart and some sail-cloth and a turnip heap provided
us with ambush. By and by certain familiar
whoops and hullohs announced that the enemy was
coming. One or two bigger boys made for the dam
(which I confess was a relief to us), but our own
particular foes advanced with a rush upon the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They hevn&rsquo;t coomed yet, hev they?&rdquo; we heard
the sexton&rsquo;s son say, as he peeped over at our pond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noa,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not gone one
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone one by t&rsquo; church. I yeard it as we
was coming up t&rsquo; lane.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- Page 113 -->&ldquo;T&rsquo; church clock&rsquo;s always hafe-an-hour fasst, thee
knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;T&rsquo; church clock&rsquo;s t&rsquo; one to go by, anyhow,&rdquo; the
sexton&rsquo;s son maintained.</p>

<p>His friend guffawed aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a reight &rsquo;un to go by too, my sakes!
when thee feyther shifts t&rsquo; time back&rsquo;ards and for&rsquo;ards
every Sunday morning to suit hissen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To suit hissen! To suit t&rsquo; ringers, ye mean!&rdquo;
said the sexton&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s thou to do wi&rsquo; t&rsquo; ringers?&rdquo; was the reply,
enforced apparently by a punch in the back, and the
two lads came cuffing and struggling up the field,
much to my alarm, but fortunately they were too busy
to notice us.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rest had not been idle at the wall.
Jem had climbed on the cart, and peeping through a
brick hole he could see that they had with some
difficulty disengaged a very heavy stone. As we were
turning our heads to watch the two lads fighting near
our hiding-place, we heard the stone strike with a
heavy thud upon the rotten ice below, and it was
echoed by a groan of satisfaction from above.</p>

<p>(&ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; I whispered.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll break somebody&rsquo;s nose when it&rsquo;s frosted
<!-- Page 114 -->in,&rdquo; cried Bob Furniss, in a tone of sincere gratification.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, Tim Binder! there&rsquo;ll be a rare job for thee
feyther next spring, fettling up this wall, by t&rsquo; time
we&rsquo;ve done wi&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me come,&rdquo; we heard Tim say. &ldquo;Thou
can&rsquo;t handle a stone. Let me come. Th&rsquo; ice is as
soft as loppered milk, and i&rsquo; ten minutes, I&rsquo;ll fill yon
bit they&rsquo;re so chuff of skating on, as thick wi&rsquo; stones
as a quarry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; I said.)</p>

<p>Our foes considerably outnumbered us, but I
think they were at a disadvantage. They had worked
off a good deal of their steam, and ours was at
explosion point. We took them by surprise and in
the rear. They had had some hard exercise, and we
were panting to begin. As a matter of fact those
who could get away ran away. We caught all we
could, and punched and pummelled and rolled them
in the snow to our hearts&rsquo; content.</p>

<p>Jem never was much of a talker, and I never
knew him speak when he was fighting; but three
several times on this occasion, I heard him say very
stiffly and distinctly (he was on the top of Tim Binder),
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fettle thee! I&rsquo;ll fettle thee! I&rsquo;ll fettle thee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The battle was over, the victory was ours, but the
campaign was not ended, and thenceforward the dis<!-- Page 115 -->advantages
would be for us. Even real warfare is
complicated when men fight with men less civilized
than themselves; and we had learnt before now that
when we snowballed each other or snowballed the
rougher &ldquo;lot&rdquo; of village boys, we did so under
different conditions. <i>We</i> had our own code of
honour and fairness, but Bob Furniss was not above
putting a stone into a snowball if he owed a grudge.</p>

<p>So when we heard a rumour that the bigger
&ldquo;roughs&rdquo; were going to join the younger ones, and
lie in wait to &ldquo;pay us off&rdquo; the first day we came
down to the ice, I cannot say we felt comfortable,
though we resolved to be courageous. Meanwhile,
the thaw continued, which suspended operations, and
gave time, which is good for healing; and Christmas
came, and we and our foes met and mingled in the
mummeries of the season, and wished each other
Happy New Years, and said nothing about the pond.</p>

<p>How my father came to hear of the matter we did
not know at the time, but one morning he summoned
Jem and me, and bade us tell him all about it. I
was always rather afraid of my father, and I should
have made out a very stammering story, but Jem
flushed up like a turkey-cock, and gave our version of
the business very straightforwardly. The other side
of the tale my father had evidently heard, and we
fancied he must have heard also of the intended
<!-- Page 116 -->attack on us, for it never took place, and we knew
of interviews which he had with John Binder and
others of our neighbours; and when the frost came in
January, we found that the stones had been taken out
of the pond, and my father gave us a sharp lecture
against being quarrelsome and giving ourselves airs,
and it ended with&mdash;&ldquo;The pond is mine. I wish you
to remember it, because it makes it your duty to be
hospitable and civil to the boys I allow to go on it.
And I have very decidedly warned them and their
parents to remember it, because if my permission for
fair amusement is abused to damage and trespass, I
shall withdraw the favour and prosecute intruders.
But the day I shut up my pond from my neighbours,
I shall forbid you and Jack to go on it again unless
the fault is more entirely on one side than it&rsquo;s likely
to be when boys squabble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My father waved our dismissal, but I hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boys won&rsquo;t think we told tales to you to get
out of another fight?&rdquo; I gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody knows perfectly well how I heard.
It came to the sexton&rsquo;s ears, and he very properly
informed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt relieved, and the first day we had on the ice
went off very fairly. The boys were sheepish at first
and slow to come on, and when they had assembled
in force they were inclined to be bullying. But Jem
<!-- Page 117 -->and I kept our tempers, and by and by my father
came down to see us, and headed a long slide in
which we and our foes were combined. As he left he
pinched Jem&rsquo;s frosty ear, and said, &ldquo;Let me hear if
there&rsquo;s any real malice, but don&rsquo;t double your fists at
every trifle. Slide and let slide! slide and let slide!&rdquo;
And he took a pinch of snuff and departed.</p>

<p>And Jem was wonderfully peaceable for the rest of
the day. A word from my father went a long way
with him. They were very fond of each other.</p>

<p>I had no love of fighting for fighting&rsquo;s sake, and I
had other interests besides sliding and skating; so I
was well satisfied that we got through the January
frost without further breaches of the peace. Towards
the end of the month we all went a good deal upon
the mill-dam, and Mr. Wood (assisted by me as far as
watching, handing tools and asking questions went)
made a rough sledge, in which he pushed Charlie
before him as he skated; and I believe the village
boys, as well as his own school-fellows, were glad that
Cripple Charlie had a share in the winter fun, for
wherever Mr. Wood drove him, both sliders and
skaters made way.</p>

<p>And even on the pond there were no more real
battles that winter. Only now and then some mischievous
urchin tripped up our brand-new skates, and
begged our pardon as he left us on our backs. And
<!-- Page 118 -->more than once, when &ldquo;the island&rdquo; in the middle of
the pond was a very fairyland of hoar-frosted twigs and
snow-plumed larches, I have seen its white loveliness
rudely shaken, and skating round to discover the
cause, have beheld Jem, with cheeks redder than his
scarlet comforter, return an &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; shove with
interest; or posed like a ruffled robin redbreast, to
defend a newly-made slide against intruders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first day of February was mild, and foggy, and
cloudy, and in the night I woke feeling very hot, and
threw off my quilt, and heard the dripping of soft rain
in the dark outside, and thought, &ldquo;There goes our
skating.&rdquo; Towards morning, however, I woke again,
and had to pull the quilt back into its place, and when
I started after breakfast to see what the dam looked
like, there was a sharpish frost, which, coming after a
day of thaw, had given the ice such a fine smooth
surface as we had not had for long.</p>

<p>I felt quite sorry for Jem, because he was going in
the dog-cart with my father to see a horse, and as I
hadn&rsquo;t got him to skate with, I went down to the farm
after breakfast, to see what Charlie and the Woods
were going to do. Charlie was not well, but Mr.
<!-- Page 120 -->Wood said he would come to the dam with me after
dinner, as he had to go to the next village on business,
and the dam lay in his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep to the pond this morning, Jack,&rdquo; he
added, to my astonishment. &ldquo;Remember it thawed
all yesterday; and if the wheel was freed and has
been turning, it has run water off from under the ice,
and all may not be sound that&rsquo;s smooth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pond was softer than it looked, but the mill-dam
was most tempting. A sheet of &ldquo;glare ice,&rdquo; as
Americans say, smooth and clear as a newly-washed
window-pane. I did not go on it, but I brought Mr.
Wood to it early in the afternoon, in the full hope
that he would give me leave.</p>

<p>We found several young men on the bank, some
fastening their skates and some trying the ice with
their heels, and as we stood there the numbers increased,
and most of them went on without hesitation;
and when they rushed in groups together, I noticed
that the ice slightly swayed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ice bends a good deal,&rdquo; said Mr. Wood to a
man standing next to us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say it&rsquo;s not so like to break when it
bends,&rdquo; was the reply; and the man moved on.</p>

<p>A good many of the elder men from the village
had come up, and a group, including John Binder,
now stood alongside of us.</p>

<p><!-- Page 121 -->&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good sup of water atop of it,&rdquo; said the
mason; and I noticed then that the ice seemed to
look wetter, like newly-washed glass still, but like
glass that wants wiping dry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the ice is not safe,&rdquo; said the school-master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tidy thickness, sir,&rdquo; said John Binder, and
a heavy man, with his hands in his pockets and his
back turned to us, stepped down and gave two or
three jumps, and then got up again, and, with his
back still turned towards us, said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s reight enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right enough for one man, but not for a
crowd, I&rsquo;m afraid. Was the water-wheel freed last
night, do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was loosed last night, but it&rsquo;s froz again,&rdquo; said
a bystander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not freezing now,&rdquo; said the school-master,
&ldquo;and you may see how much larger that weak place
where the stream is has got since yesterday. However,&rdquo;
he added, good-humouredly, &ldquo;I suppose you
think you know your own mill-dam and its ways better
than I can?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the heavy man, still with his back to
us, &ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;ve slid on this dam a many winters
afore <i>you</i> come. No offence, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said the school-master; &ldquo;but if
<!-- Page 122 -->you old hands do begin to feel doubtful as the afternoon
goes on, call off those lads at the other end in
good time. And if you could warn them not to go in
rushes together&mdash;but perhaps they would not listen to
you,&rdquo; he added with a spice of malice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose they would, sir,&rdquo; said John
Binder, candidly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very venturesome, is
lads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon they&rsquo;ll suit themselves,&rdquo; said the heavy
man, and he jumped on to the ice, and went off, still
with his back to us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t lived so many years out of England
and out of the world,&rdquo; said the school-master, turning
to me with a half-vexed laugh, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I
should discredit myself to no purpose by telling fools
they are in danger. Jack! will you promise me not
to go on the dam this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is dangerous, is it?&rdquo; I asked reluctantly; for
I wanted sorely to join the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a matter of opinion, it seems. But I have
a wish that you should not go on till I come back.
I&rsquo;ll be as quick as I can. Promise me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you walk with me?&rdquo; he asked. But I
refused. I thought I would rather watch the others;
and accordingly, after I had followed the school-master
with my eyes as he strode off at a pace that promised
<!-- Page 123 -->soon to bring him back, I put my hands into my
pockets and joined the groups of watchers on the
bank. I suppose if I had thought about it, I might
have observed that though I was dawdling about, my
nose and ears and fingers were not nipped. Mr.
Wood was right,&mdash;it had not been freezing for hours
past.</p>

<p>The first thing I looked for was the heavy man.
He was so clumsy-looking that I quite expected him
to fall when he walked off on to ice only fit for skaters.
But as I looked closer I saw that the wet on the top
was beginning to have a curdled look, and that the
glassiness of the mill-dam was much diminished. The
heavy man&rsquo;s heavy boots got good foothold, and
several of his friends, seeing this, went after him.
And my promise weighed sorely on me.</p>

<p>The next thing that drew my attention was a lad
of about seventeen, who was skating really well.
Indeed, everybody was looking at him, for he was the
only one of the villagers who could perform in any
but the clumsiest fashion, and, with an active interest
that hovered between jeering and applause, his neighbours
followed him up and down the dam. As I
might not go on, I wandered up and down the bank
too, and occasionally joined in a murmured cheer
when he deftly evaded some intentional blunderer, or
cut a figure at the request of his particular friends. I
<!-- Page 124 -->got tired at last, and went down to the pond, where I
ploughed about for a time on my skates in solitude,
for the pond was empty. Then I ran up to the house
to see if Jem had come back, but he had not, and I
returned to the dam to wait for the school-master.</p>

<p>The crowd was larger than before, for everybody&rsquo;s
work-hours were over; and the skater was still displaying
himself. He was doing very difficult figures
now, and I ran round to where the bank was covered
with people watching him. In the minute that followed
I remember three things with curious distinctness.
First, that I saw Mr. Wood coming back, only
one field off, and beckoned to him to be quick, because
the lad was beginning to cut a double three backwards,
and I wanted the school-master to see it. Secondly,
that the sight of him seemed suddenly to bring to my
mind that we were all on the far side of the dam, the
side he thought dangerous. And thirdly, that, quickly
as my eyes passed from Mr. Wood to the skater, I
caught sight of a bloated-looking young man, whom
we all knew as a sort of typical &ldquo;bad lot,&rdquo; standing
with another man who was a great better, and from a
movement between them, it just flashed through my
head that they were betting as to whether the lad
would cut the double three backwards or not.</p>

<p>He cut one&mdash;two&mdash;and then he turned too quickly
and his skate caught in the softening ice, and when
<!-- Page 125 -->he came headlong, his head struck, and where it
struck it went through. It looked so horrible that it
was a relief to see him begin to struggle; but the
weakened ice broke around him with every effort, and
he went down.</p>

<p>For many a year afterwards I used to dream of
his face as he sank, and of the way the ice heaved
like the breast of some living thing, and fell back, and
of the heavy waves that rippled over it out of that
awful hole. But great as was the shock, it was small
to the storm of shame and agony that came over me
when I realized that every comrade who had been
around the lad had saved himself by a rush to the
bank, where we huddled together, a gaping crowd of
foolhardy cowards, without skill to do anything or
heart to dare anything to save him.</p>

<p>At that time it maddened me so, that I felt that if
I could not help the lad I would rather be drowned
in the hole with him, and I began to scramble in a
foolish way down the bank, but John Binder caught
me by the arm and pulled me back, and said (I
suppose to soothe me),</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yon&rsquo;s the school-master, sir;&rdquo; and then I saw
Mr. Wood fling himself over the hedge by the alder
thicket (he was rather good at high jumps), and come
flying along the bank towards us, when he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- Page 126 -->I threw my arms round him and sobbed, &ldquo;He
was cutting a double three backwards, and he
went in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Wood unclasped my arms and turned to the
rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you done with him?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did
he hurt himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the crowd was cowardly and helpless, it was not
indifferent; and I shall never forget the haggard faces
that turned by one impulse, where a dozen grimy
hands pointed&mdash;to the hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s drowned dead.&rdquo; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s under t&rsquo; ice.&rdquo;
&ldquo;He went right down,&rdquo; several men hastened to
reply, but most of them only enforced the mute explanation
of their pointed finger with, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For yet an instant I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Wood
believed it, and then he seized the man next to him
(without looking, for he was blind with rage) and
said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s yonder, <i>and you&rsquo;re here</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As it happened, it was the man who had talked
with his back to us. He was very big and very
heavy, but he reeled when Mr. Wood shook him, like
a feather caught by a storm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were foolhardy enough an hour ago,&rdquo; said
the school-master. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t one of you venture on to
your own dam to help a drowning man?&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- Page 127 -->&ldquo;There&rsquo;s none on us can swim, sir,&rdquo; said John
Binder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad job&rdquo;&mdash;and he gave a sob that
made me begin to cry again, and several other people
too&mdash;&ldquo;but where&rsquo;d be t&rsquo; use of drowning five or six
more atop of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can any of you run if you can&rsquo;t swim?&rdquo; said the
school-master. &ldquo;Get a stout rope&mdash;as fast as you can,
and send somebody for the doctor and a bottle of
brandy, and a blanket or two to carry him home in.
Jack! Hold these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took his watch and his purse, and he went down
the bank and walked on to the ice; but after a
time his feet went through as the skater&rsquo;s head had
gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a bit of use. There&rsquo;s nought to be
done,&rdquo; said the bystanders: for, except those who had
run to do Mr. Wood&rsquo;s bidding, we were all watching
and all huddled closer to the edge than ever. The
school-master went down on his hands and knees, on
which a big lad, with his hands in his trouser-pockets,
guffawed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he up to now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thee may haud thee tongue if thee can do
nought,&rdquo; said a mill-girl who had come up. &ldquo;I
reckon he knows what he&rsquo;s efter better nor thee.&rdquo;
She had pushed to the front, and was crouched upon
the edge, and seemed very much excited. &ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span>
<!-- Page 128 -->bless him for trying to save t&rsquo; best lad in t&rsquo; village i&rsquo;
any fashion, say I! There&rsquo;s them that&rsquo;s nearer kin to
him and not so kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps the strict justice of this taunt prevented a
reply (for there lurks some fairness in the roughest
of us), or perhaps the crowd, being chiefly men knew
from experience that there are occasions when it is
best to let a woman say her say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye see he&rsquo;s trying to spread hisself out,&rdquo; John
Binder explained in pacific tones. &ldquo;I reckon he
thinks it&rsquo;ll bear him if he shifts half of his weight on
to his hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl got nearer to the mason, and looked up
at him with her eyes full of tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, John,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye think he&rsquo;ll
get him out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he will, my lass. He&rsquo;s a man that knows
what he&rsquo;s doing. I&rsquo;ll say so much for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; added the mason sorrowfully. &ldquo;Th&rsquo; ice&rsquo;ll
never hold him&mdash;his hand&rsquo;s in&mdash;and there goes his
knee. Maester! maester!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;come off!
come off!&rdquo; and many a voice besides mine echoed
him, &ldquo;Come off! come off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl got John Binder by the arm, and said
hoarsely, &ldquo;Fetch him off! He&rsquo;s a reight good &rsquo;un&mdash;over
good to be drownded, if&mdash;if it&rsquo;s of no use.&rdquo;
And she sat down on the bank, and pulled her mill-<!-- Page 129 -->shawl
over her head, and cried as I had never seen
any one cry before.</p>

<p>I was so busy watching her that I did not see that
Mr. Wood had got back to the bank. Several hands
were held out to help him, but he shook his head and
said&mdash;&ldquo;Got a knife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two or three jack-knives were out in an instant.
He pointed to the alder thicket. &ldquo;I want two poles,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;sixteen feet long, if you can, and as thick as
my wrist at the bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat down on the bank, and I rushed up and
took one of his cold wet hands in both mine, and
said, &ldquo;Please, please, don&rsquo;t go on any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be dead ever so long ago,&rdquo; I added,
repeating what I had heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been in the water ten minutes,&rdquo; said
the school-master, laughing, &ldquo;Jack! Jack! you&rsquo;re not
half ready for travelling yet. You must learn not to
lose your head and your heart and your wits and
your sense of time in this fashion, if you mean to be
any good at a pinch to yourself or your neighbours.
Has the rope come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those poles?&rdquo; said the school-master, getting up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; I shouted, as a young forest of
poles came towards us, so willing had been the owners
<!-- Page 130 -->of the jack-knives. The thickest had been cut by the
heavy man, and Mr. Wood took it first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, friend,&rdquo; he said. The man didn&rsquo;t
speak, and he turned his back as usual, but he gave a
sideways surly nod before he turned. The school-master
chose a second pole, and then pushed both
before him right out on to the ice, in such a way that
with the points touching each other they formed a
sort of huge A, the thicker ends being the nearer to
the bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Jack,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;pay attention; and no
more blubbering. There&rsquo;s always plenty of time for
giving way <i>afterwards</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke he scrambled on to the poles, and
began to work himself and them over the ice, wriggling
in a kind of snake fashion in the direction of the
hole. We watched him breathlessly, but within ten
yards of the hole he stopped. He evidently dared
not go on; and the same thought seized all of us&mdash;&ldquo;Can
he get back?&rdquo; Spreading his legs and arms
he now lay flat upon the poles, peering towards the
hole as if to try if he could see anything of the drowning
man. It was only for an instant, then he rolled
over on to the rotten ice, smashed through, and sank
more suddenly than the skater had done.</p>

<p>The mill-girl jumped up with a wild cry and
rushed to the water, but John Binder pulled her back
<!-- Page 131 -->as he had pulled me. Martha, our housemaid, said
afterwards (and was ready to take oath on the gilt-edged
Church service my mother gave her) that the
girl was so violent that it took fourteen men to hold
her; but Martha wasn&rsquo;t there, and I only saw two,
one at each arm, and when she fainted they laid her
down and left her, and hurried back to see what was
going on. For tenderness is an acquired grace in
men, and it was not common in our neighbourhood.</p>

<p>What was going on was that John Binder had torn
his hat from his head and was saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
if there&rsquo;s aught we <i>can</i> do, but I can&rsquo;t go home myself
and leave him yonder. I&rsquo;m a married man with a
family, but I don&rsquo;t vally <i>my</i> life if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the rest of this speech was drowned in noise
more eloquent than words, and then it broke into
cries of &ldquo;See thee!&mdash;It is&mdash;it&rsquo;s t&rsquo; maester! and he has&mdash;no!&mdash;yea!&mdash;he
<i>has</i>&mdash;he&rsquo;s gotten him. Polly, lass!
he&rsquo;s fetched up thy Arthur by t&rsquo; hair of his heead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was strictly true. The school-master told me
afterwards how it was. When he found that the ice
would bear no longer, he rolled into the water on
purpose, but, to his horror, he felt himself seized by
the drowning man, which pulled him suddenly down.
The lad had risen once, it seems, though we had not
seen him, and had got a breath of air at the hole, but
the edge broke in his numbed fingers, and he sank
<!-- Page 132 -->again and drifted under the ice. When he rose the
second time, by an odd chance it was just where Mr.
Wood broke in, and his clutch of the school-master
nearly cost both their lives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ever,&rdquo; said Mr. Wood, when he was talking
about it afterwards, &ldquo;if ever, Jack, when you&rsquo;re out in
the world you get under water, and somebody tries to
save you, when he grips <i>you</i>, don&rsquo;t seize <i>him</i>, if you
can muster self-control to avoid it. If you cling to
him, you&rsquo;ll either drown both, or you&rsquo;ll force him to do
as I did&mdash;throttle you, to keep you quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; I gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I did. I got him by the throat and
dived with him&mdash;the only real risk I ran, as I did not
know how deep the dam was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old quarry,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know now. We went down well, and I
squeezed his throat as we went. As soon as he was
still we naturally rose, and I turned on my back and
got him by the head. I looked about for the hole,
and saw it glimmering above me like a moon in a fog,
and then up we came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they did come up, our joy was so great that
for the moment we felt as if all was accomplished;
but far the hardest part really was to come. When
the school-master clutched the poles once more, and
drove one under the lad&rsquo;s arms and under his own
<!-- Page 133 -->left arm, and so kept his burden afloat whilst he broke
a swimming path for himself with the other, our
admiration of his cleverness gave place to the blessed
thought that it might now be possible to help him.
The sight of the poles seemed suddenly to suggest it,
and in a moment every spare pole had been seized,
and, headed by our heavy friend, eight or ten men
plunged in, and, smashing the ice before them, waded
out to meet the school-master. On the bank we were
dead silent; in the water they neither stopped nor
spoke till it was breast high round their leader.</p>

<p>I have often thought, and have always felt quite
sure, that if the heavy man had gone on till the little
grey waves and the bits of ice closed over him, not a
soul of those who followed him would&mdash;nay, <i>could</i>&mdash;have
turned back. Heroism, like cowardice, is contagious,
and I do not think there was one of us by
that time who would have feared to dare or grudged
to die.</p>

<p>As it was, the heavy man stood still and shouted
for the rope. It had come, and perhaps it was not
the smallest effect of the day&rsquo;s teaching, that those on
the bank paid it out at once to those in the water till
it reached the leader, without waiting to ask why he
wanted it. The grace of obedience is slow to be
learnt by disputatious northmen, but we had had
some hard teaching that afternoon.</p>

<p><!-- Page 134 -->When the heavy man got the rope he tied the
middle part of it round himself, and, coiling the
shorter end, he sent it, as if it had been a quoit,
skimming over the ice towards the school-master. As
it unwound itself it slid along, and after a struggle Mr.
Wood grasped it. I fancy he fastened it round the
lad&rsquo;s body; and got his own hands freer to break the
ice before them. Then the heavy man turned, and
the long end of the line, passing from hand to hand
in the water, was seized upon the bank by every one
who could get hold of it. I never was more squeezed
and buffeted in my life; but we fairly fought for the
privilege of touching if it were but a strand of the rope
that dragged them in.</p>

<p>And a flock of wild birds, resting on their journey
at the other end of the mill-dam, rose in terror and
pursued their seaward way; so wild and so prolonged
were the echoes of that strange, speechless cry in
which collective man gives vent to overpowering
emotion.</p>

<p>It is odd, when one comes to think of it, but I
know it is true, for two sensible words would have
stuck in my own throat and choked me, but I cheered
till I could cheer no longer.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&ldquo;In doubtful matters Courage may do much:&mdash;In desperate&mdash;Patience.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Old Proverb</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> young skater duly recovered, and thenceforward
Mr. Wood&rsquo;s popularity in the village was
established, and the following summer he started a
swimming-class, to which the young men flocked
with more readiness than they commonly showed
for efforts made to improve them.</p>

<p>For my own part I had so realized, to my shame,
that one may feel very adventurous and yet not know
how to venture or what to venture in the time of
need, that my whole heart was set upon getting the
school-master to teach me to swim and to dive, with
any other lessons in preparedness of body and mind
which I was old enough to profit by. And if the
true tales of his own experiences were more interesting
than the Penny Numbers, it was better still to feel
that one was qualifying in one&rsquo;s own proper person
for a life of adventure.</p>

<p>During the winter Mr. Wood built a boat, which
<!-- Page 136 -->was christened the <i>Adela</i>, after his wife. It was
an interesting process to us all. I hung about and
did my best to be helpful, and both Jem and I
spoiled our everyday trousers, and rubbed the boat&rsquo;s
sides, the day she was painted. It was from the
<i>Adela</i> that Jem and I had our first swimming-lessons,
Mr. Wood lowering us with a rope under our arms,
by which he gave us as much support as was needed,
whilst he taught us how to strike out.</p>

<p>We had swimming-races on the canal, and having
learned to swim and dive without our clothes, we
learnt to do so in them, and found it much more
difficult for swimming and easier for diving. It was
then that the trousers we had damaged when the
<i>Adela</i> was built came in most usefully, and saved us
from having to attempt the at least equally difficult
task of persuading my mother to let us spoil good
ones in an amusement which had the unpardonable
quality of being &ldquo;very odd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dear old Charlie had as much fun out of the
boat as we had, though he could not learn to dive.
He used to look as if every minute of a pull up the
canal on a sunny evening gave him pleasure; and
the brown Irish spaniel Jem gave him used to swim
after the boat and look up in Charlie&rsquo;s face as if it
knew how he enjoyed it. And later on, Mr. Wood
taught Bob Furniss to row and Charlie to steer; so
<!-- Page 137 -->that Charlie could sometimes go out and feel quite
free to stop the boat when and where he liked. That
was after he started so many collections of insects
and water-weeds, and shells, and things you can only
see under a microscope. Bob and he used to take
all kinds of pots and pans and nets and dippers with
them, so that Charlie could fish up what he wanted,
and keep things separate. He was obliged to keep
the live things he got for his fresh-water aquarium in
different jam-pots, because he could never be sure
which would eat up which till he knew them better,
and the water-scorpions and the dragon-fly larv&aelig; ate
everything. Bob Furniss did not mind pulling in
among the reeds and waiting as long as you wanted.
Mr. Wood sometimes wanted to get back to his work,
but Bob never wanted to get back to his. And he
was very good-natured about getting into the water
and wading and grubbing for things; indeed, I think
he got to like it.</p>

<p>At first Mr. Wood had been rather afraid of
trusting Charlie with him. He thought Bob might
play tricks with the boat, even though he knew how
to manage her, when there was only one helpless boy
with him. But Mrs. Furniss said, &ldquo;Nay! Our
Bob&rsquo;s a bad &rsquo;un, but he&rsquo;s not one of that sort, he&rsquo;ll
not plague them that&rsquo;s afflicted.&rdquo; And she was quite
right; for though his father said he could be trusted
<!-- Page 138 -->with nothing else, we found he could be trusted with
Cripple Charlie.</p>

<p>It was two days before the summer holidays came
to an end that Charlie asked me to come down to
the farm and help him to put away his fern collection
and a lot of other things into the places that he had
arranged for them in his room; for now that the
school-room was wanted again, he could not leave his
papers and boxes about there. Charlie lived at the
farm altogether now. He was better there than on
the moors, so he boarded there and went home for
visits. The room Mrs. Wood had given him was the
one where the old miser had slept. In a memorandum
left with his will it appeared that he had expressed
a wish that the furniture of that room should not
be altered, which was how they knew it was his.
So Mrs. Wood had kept the curious old oak bed
(the back of which was fastened into the wall), and
an old oak press, with a great number of drawers
with brass handles to them, and all the queer furniture
that she found there, just as it was. Even the brass
warming-pan was only rubbed and put back in its
place, and the big bellows were duly hung up by
the small fire-place. But everything was so polished
up and cleaned, the walls re-papered with a soft grey-green
paper spangled with dog-daisies, and the room
so brightened up with fresh blinds and bedclothes,
<!-- Page 139 -->and a bit of bright carpet, that it did not look in the
least dismal, and Charlie was very proud and very
fond of it. It had two windows, one where the beehive
was, and one very sunny one, where he had a
balm of Gilead that Isaac&rsquo;s wife gave him, and his
old medicine-bottles full of cuttings on the upper
ledge. The old women used to send him &ldquo;slippings&rdquo;
off their fairy roses and myrtles and fuchsias, and
they rooted very well in that window, there was so
much sun.</p>

<p>Charlie had only just begun a fern collection, and
I had saved my pocket-money (I did not want it
for anything else) and had bought him several quires
of cartridge-paper; and Dr. Brown had given him a
packet of medicine-labels to cut up into strips to
fasten his specimens in with, and the collection
looked very well and very scientific; and all that
remained was to find a good place to put it away in.
The drawers of the press were of all shapes and sizes,
but there were two longish very shallow ones that
just matched each other, and when I pulled one of
them out, and put the fern-papers in, they fitted
exactly, and the drawer just held half the collection.
I called Charlie to look, and he hobbled up on his
crutches and was delighted, but he said he should
like to put the others in himself, so I got him into a
chair, and shut up the full drawer and pulled out the
<!-- Page 140 -->empty one, and went down-stairs for the two moleskins
we were curing, and the glue-pot, and the toffy-tin,
and some other things that had to be cleared out
of the school-room now the holidays were over.</p>

<p>When I came back the fern-papers were still
outside, and Charlie was looking flushed and cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you managed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
I can&rsquo;t get them in. This drawer must be shorter
than the other; it doesn&rsquo;t go nearly so far back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, it does, Charlie!&rdquo; I insisted, for I felt
as certain as people always do feel about little details
of that kind. &ldquo;The drawers are exactly alike; you
can&rsquo;t have got the fern-sheets quite flush with each
other,&rdquo; and I began to arrange the trayful of things I
had brought up-stairs in the bottom of the cupboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>know</i> it&rsquo;s the drawer,&rdquo; I heard Charlie say.
(&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as obstinate as possible,&rdquo; thought I.)</p>

<p>Then I heard him banging at the wood with his
fists and his crutch. (&ldquo;He <i>is</i> in a temper!&rdquo; was
my mental comment.) After this my attention was
distracted for a second or two by seeing what I
thought was a bit of toffy left in the tin, and biting
it and finding it was a piece of sheet-glue. I had
not spit out all the disgust of it, when Charlie called
me in low, awe-struck tones: &ldquo;Jack! come here.
Quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ran to him. The drawer was open, but it
<!-- Page 141 -->seemed to have another drawer inside it, a long,
narrow, shallow one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hit the back, and this sprang out,&rdquo; said Charlie.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a secret drawer&mdash;and look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did look. The secret drawer was closely packed
with rolls of thin leaflets, which we were old enough
to recognize as bank-notes, and with little bags of
wash-leather; and when Charlie opened the little
bags they were filled with gold.</p>

<p>There was a paper with the money, written by
the old miser, to say that it was a codicil to his
will, and that the money was all for Mrs. Wood.
Why he had not left it to her in the will itself
seemed very puzzling, but his lawyer (whom the
Woods consulted about it) said that he always did
things in a very eccentric way, but generally for
some sort of reason, even if it were rather a freaky
one, and that perhaps he thought that the relations
would be less spiteful at first if they did not know
about the money, and that Mrs. Wood would soon
find it, if she used and valued his old press.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t quite know whether there was any fuss
with the relations about this part of the bequest,
but I suppose the lawyer managed it all right, for
the Woods got the money and gave up the school.
But they kept the old house, and bought some more
land, and Walnut-tree Academy became Walnut-tree
<!-- Page 142 -->Farm once more. And Cripple Charlie lived on
with them, and he was so happy, it really seemed
as if my dear mother was right when she said to
my father, &ldquo;I am so pleased, my dear, for that poor
boy&rsquo;s sake, I can hardly help crying. He&rsquo;s got two
homes and two fathers and mothers, where many a
young man has none, as if to make good his affliction
to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It puzzles me, even now, to think how my father
could have sent Jem and me to Crayshaw&rsquo;s school.
(Nobody ever called him Mr. Crayshaw except the
parents of pupils who lived at a distance. In the
neighbourhood he and his whole establishment were
lumped under the one word <i>Crayshaw&rsquo;s</i>, and as a
farmer hard by once said to me, &ldquo;Crayshaw&rsquo;s is
universally disrespected.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>I do not think it was merely because &ldquo;Crayshaw&rsquo;s&rdquo;
was cheap that we were sent there, though my father
had so few reasons to give for his choice that he
quoted that among them. A man with whom he
had had business dealings (which gave him much
satisfaction for some years, and more dissatisfaction
afterwards) did really, I think, persuade my father to
send us to this school, one evening when they were
dining together.</p>

<p>Few things are harder to guess at than the grounds
on which an Englishman of my father&rsquo;s type &ldquo;makes
<!-- Page 143 -->up his mind&rdquo;; and yet the question is an important
one, for an idea once lodged in his head, a conviction
once as much his own as the family acres, and you
will as soon part him from the one as from the other.
I have known little matters of domestic improvements,
in which my mother&rsquo;s comfort was concerned and her
experience conclusive, for which he grudged a few
shillings, and was absolutely impenetrable by her
persuasions and representations. And I have known
him waste pounds on things of the most curious
variety, foisted on him by advertising agents without
knowledge, trial, or rational ground of confidence.
I suppose that persistency, a glibber tongue than he
himself possessed, a mass of printed rubbish which
always looks imposing to the unliterary, that primitive
combination of authoritativeness and hospitality which
makes some men as ready to say Yes to a stranger as
they are to say No at home, and perhaps some lack
of moral courage, may account for it. I can clearly
remember how quaintly sheepish my father used to
look after committing some such folly, and how, after
the first irrepressible fall of countenance, my mother
would have defended him against anybody else&rsquo;s
opinion, let alone her own. Young as I was I could feel
that, and had a pretty accurate estimate of the value of
the moral lecture on faith in one&rsquo;s fellow-creatures,
which was an unfailing outward sign of my father&rsquo;s
<!-- Page 144 -->inward conviction that he had been taken in by a
rogue. I knew too, well enough, that my mother&rsquo;s
hasty and earnest Amen to this discourse was an
equally reliable token of her knowledge that my father
sorely needed defending, and some instinct made me
aware also that my father knew that this was so. That
he knew that it was that tender generosity towards
one&rsquo;s beloved, in which so many of her sex so far exceeds
ours, and not an intellectual conviction of his wisdom,
which made her support what he had done, and that
feeling this he felt dissatisfied, and snapped at her
accordingly.</p>

<p>The dislike my dear mother took to the notion of
our going to Crayshaw&rsquo;s only set seals to our fate, and
the manner of her protests was not more fortunate
than the matter. She was timid and vacillating from
wifely habit, whilst motherly anxiety goaded her to be
persistent and almost irritable on the subject. Habitually
regarding her own wishes and views as worthless,
she quoted the Woods at every turn of her arguments,
which was a mistake, for my father was sufficiently
like the rest of his neighbours not to cotton very
warmly to people whose tastes, experiences, and lines
of thought were so much out of the common as those
of the ex-convict and his wife. Moreover, he had
made up his mind, and when one has done that, he
is proof against seventy men who can render a reason.</p>

<p><!-- Page 145 -->To rumours which accused &ldquo;Crayshaw&rsquo;s&rdquo; of
undue severity, of discomfort, of bad teaching and
worse manners, my father opposed arguments which
he allowed were &ldquo;old-fashioned&rdquo; and which were far-fetched
from the days of our great-grandfather.</p>

<p>A strict school-master was a good school-master,
and if more parents were as wise as Solomon on the
subject of the rod, Old England would not be discredited
by such a namby-pamby race as young men
of the present day seemed by all accounts to be. It
was high time the boys did rough it a bit; would my
mother have them always tied to her apron-strings?
Great Britain would soon be Little Britain if boys
were to be brought up like young ladies. As to
teaching, it was the fashion to make a fuss about it,
and a pretty pass learning brought some folks to, to
judge by the papers and all one heard. His own
grandfather lived to ninety-seven, and died sitting in
his chair, in a bottle-green coat and buff breeches.
He wore a pig-tail to the day of his death, and never
would be contradicted by anybody. He had often
told my father that at the school <i>he</i> went to, the
master signed the receipts for his money with a cross,
but the usher was a bit of a scholar, and the boys had
cream to their porridge on Sundays. And the old
gentleman managed his own affairs to ninety-seven,
and threw the doctor&rsquo;s medicine-bottles out of the
<!-- Page 146 -->window then. He died without a doubt on his mind
or a debt on his books, and my father (taking a pinch
out of Great-Grandfather&rsquo;s snuff-box) hoped Jem and
I might do as well.</p>

<p>In short, we were sent to &ldquo;Crayshaw&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not a happy period of my life. It was not
a good or wholesome period; and I am not fond of
recalling it. The time came when I shrank from
telling Charlie everything, almost as if he had been
a girl. His life was lived in such a different atmosphere,
under such different conditions. I could not
trouble him, and I did not believe he could make
allowances for me. But on our first arrival I wrote
him a long letter (Jem never wrote letters), and the
other day he showed it to me. It was a first impression,
but a sufficiently vivid and truthful one, so
I give it here.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0em;">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Crayshaw&rsquo;s</span> (for that&rsquo;s what they call it here, and
a beastly hole it is).</p>

<p class="p1">&ldquo;<i>Monday</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0em;">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear old Charlie</span>,&mdash;We came earlier than
was settled, for Father got impatient and there was
nothing to stop us, but I don&rsquo;t think old Crayshaw
liked our coming so soon. You never saw such a
place, it&rsquo;s so dreary. A boy showed us straight into
the school-room. There are three rows of double
<!-- Page 147 -->desks running down the room and disgustingly dirty,
I don&rsquo;t know what Mrs. Wood would say, and old
Crayshaw&rsquo;s desk is in front of the fire, so that he can
see all the boys sideways, and it just stops any heat
coming to them. And there he was, and I don&rsquo;t
think Father liked the look of him particularly, you
never saw an uglier. Such a flaming face and red
eyes like Bob Furniss&rsquo;s ferret and great big whiskers;
but I&rsquo;ll make you a picture of him, at least I&rsquo;ll make
two pictures, for Lewis Lorraine says he&rsquo;s got no
beard on Sundays, and rather a good one on Saturdays.
Lorraine is a very rum fellow, but I like him. It was
he showed us in, and he did catch it afterwards, but
he only makes fun of it. Old Crayshaw&rsquo;s desk had
got a lot of canes on one side of it and a most beastly
dirty snuffy red and green handkerchief on the other,
and an ink-pot in the middle. He made up to Father
like anything and told such thumpers. He said there
were six boys in one room, but really there&rsquo;s twelve.
Jem and I sleep together. There&rsquo;s nothing to wash
in and no prayers. If you say them you get boots at
your head, and one hit Jem behind the ear, so I
pulled his sleeve and said, &lsquo;Get up, you can say
them in bed,&rsquo; But you know Jem, and he said,
&rsquo;Wait till I&rsquo;ve done, <i>God bless Father and Mother</i>,&rsquo;
and when he had, he went in and fought, and I
<!-- Page 148 -->backed him up, and them old Crayshaw found us, and
oh, how he did beat us!</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;<i>Wednesday</i>. Old Snuffy is a regular brute,
and I don&rsquo;t care if he finds this and sees what I say.
But he won&rsquo;t, for the milkman is taking it. He
always does if you can pay him. But I&rsquo;ve put most
of my money into the bank. Three of the top boys
have a bank, and we all have to deposit, only I kept
fourpence in one of my boots. They give us bank-notes
for a penny and a halfpenny; they make them
themselves. The sweet-shop takes them. They only
give you eleven penny notes for a shilling in the bank,
or else it would burst. At dinner we have a lot of
pudding to begin with, and it&rsquo;s very heavy. You can
hardly eat anything afterwards. The first day Lorraine
said quite out loud and very polite, &lsquo;Did you
say <i>duff before meat</i>, young gentlemen?&rsquo; and I
couldn&rsquo;t help laughing, and old Snuffy beat his head
horridly with his dirty fists. But Lorraine minds
nothing; he says he knows old Snuffy will kill him
some day, but he says he doesn&rsquo;t want to live, for
his father and mother are dead; he only wants to
catch old Snuffy in three more booby-traps before he
dies. He&rsquo;s caught him in four already. You see,
when old Snuffy is cat-walking he wears goloshes that
he may sneak about better, and the way Lorraine
<!-- Page 149 -->makes booby-traps is by balancing cans of water on
the door when it&rsquo;s ajar, so that he gets doused, and
the can falls on his head, and strings across the
bottom of the door, not far from the ground, so that
he catches his goloshes and comes down. The other
fellows say that old Crayshaw had a lot of money
given him in trust for Lorraine, and he&rsquo;s spent it all,
and Lorraine has no one to stick up for him, and
that&rsquo;s why Crayshaw hates him.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0em;">&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;<i>Saturday</i>. I could not catch the milkman,
and now I&rsquo;ve got your letter, though Snuffy read it
first. Jem and I cry dreadful in bed. That&rsquo;s the
comfort of being together. I&rsquo;ll try and be as good
as I can, but you don&rsquo;t know what this place is. It&rsquo;s
very different to the farm. Do you remember the
row about that book Horace Simpson got? I wish
you could see the books the boys have here. At
least I don&rsquo;t wish it, for I wish I didn&rsquo;t look at them,
the milkman brings them; he always will if you can
pay him. When I saw old Snuffy find one in Smith&rsquo;s
desk, I expected he would half kill him, but he didn&rsquo;t
do much to him, he only took the book away; and
Lorraine says he never does beat them much for
that, because he doesn&rsquo;t want them to leave off buying
them, because he wants them himself. Don&rsquo;t tell
the Woods this. Don&rsquo;t tell Mother Jem and I cry,
or else she&rsquo;ll be miserable. I don&rsquo;t so much mind
<!-- Page 150 -->the beatings (Lorraine says you get hard in time), nor
the washing at the sink&mdash;nor the duff puddings&mdash;but
it is such a beastly hole, and he is such an old brute,
and I feel so dreadful I can&rsquo;t tell you. Give my love
to Mrs. Wood and to Mr. Wood, and to Carlo and to
Mary Anne, and to your dear dear self, and to Isaac
when you see him.</p>

<p class="p3">
<span style="margin-right: 1.5em;">&ldquo;And I am your affectionate friend,</span><br />
&ldquo;Jack.<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;P.S. Jem sends his best love, and he&rsquo;s got two
black eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;P.S. No. 2. You would be sorry for Lorraine if
you knew him. Sometimes I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll kill himself,
for he says there&rsquo;s really nothing in the Bible
about suicide. So I said&mdash;killing yourself is as bad
as killing anybody else. So he said&mdash;is stealing from
yourself as bad as stealing from anybody else? And
we had a regular <i>argue</i>. Some of the boys argle-bargle
on Sundays, he says, but most of them fight.
When they differ, they put tin-tacks with the heads
downwards on each other&rsquo;s places on the forms in
school, and if they run into you and you scream, old
Snuffy beats you. The milkman brings them, by the
half-ounce, with very sharp points, if you can pay him.
Most of the boys are a horrid lot, and so dirty.
Lorraine is as dirty as the rest, and I asked him why,
<!-- Page 151 -->and he said it was because he&rsquo;d thrown up the sponge;
but he got rather red, and he&rsquo;s washed himself cleaner
this morning. He says he has an uncle in India, and
some time ago he wrote to him, and told him about
Crayshaw&rsquo;s, and gave the milkman a diamond pin,
that had been his father&rsquo;s, and Snuffy didn&rsquo;t know
about, to post it with plenty of stamps, but he thinks
he can&rsquo;t have put plenty on, for no answer ever came.
I&rsquo;ve told him I&rsquo;ll post another one for him in the
holidays. Don&rsquo;t say anything about this back in
your letters. He reads &rsquo;em all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;<i>Monday</i>. I&rsquo;ve caught the milkman at last,
he&rsquo;ll take it this evening. The lessons here are regular
rubbish. I&rsquo;m so glad I&rsquo;ve a good knife, for if you
have you can dig holes in your desk to put collections
in. The boy next to me has earwigs, but you have to
keep a look-out, or he puts them in your ears. I
turned up a stone near the sink this morning, and got
five wood-lice for mine. It&rsquo;s considered a very good
collection.&rdquo;</p>

</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> many people say that all suffering is good
for one, and I am sure pain does improve one very
often, and in many ways. It teaches one sympathy,
it softens and it strengthens. But I cannot help
thinking that there are some evil experiences which
only harden and stain. The best I can say for what
we endured at Crayshaw&rsquo;s is that it <i>was</i> experience,
and so I suppose could not fail to teach one something,
which, as Jem says, was &ldquo;more than Snuffy
did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The affection with which I have heard men speak
of their school-days and school-masters makes me know
that Mr. Crayshaw was not a common type of pedagogue.
He was not a common type of man, happily;
<!-- Page 153 -->but I have met other specimens in other parts of the
world in which his leading quality was as fully developed,
though their lives had nothing in common
with his except the opportunities of irresponsible
power.</p>

<p>The old wounds are scars now, it is long past and
over, and I am grown up, and have roughed it in the
world; but I say quite deliberately that I believe that
Mr. Crayshaw was not merely a harsh man, uncultured
and inconsiderate, having need and greed of money,
taking pupils cheap, teaching them little or nothing,
and keeping a kind of rough order with too much
flogging,&mdash;but that the mischief of him was that he
was possessed by a passion (not the less fierce because
it was unnatural) which grew with indulgence and
opportunity, as other passions grow, and that this was
a passion for cruelty.</p>

<p>One does not rough it long in this wicked world
without seeing more cruelty both towards human
beings and towards animals than one cares to think
about; but a large proportion of common cruelty
comes of ignorance, bad tradition and uncultured
sympathies. Some painful outbreaks of inhumanity,
where one would least expect it, are no doubt strictly
to be accounted for by disease. But over and above
these common and these exceptional instances, one
cannot escape the conviction that irresponsible power
<!-- Page 154 -->is opportunity in all hands and a direct temptation in
some to cruelty, and that it affords horrible development
to those morbid cases in which cruelty becomes
a passion.</p>

<p>That there should ever come a thirst for blood in
men as well as tigers, is bad enough but conceivable
when linked with deadly struggle, or at the wild dictates
of revenge. But a lust for cruelty growing
fiercer by secret and unchecked indulgence, a hideous
pleasure in seeing and inflicting pain, seems so
inhuman a passion that we shrink from acknowledging
that this is ever so.</p>

<p>And if it belonged to the past alone, to barbarous
despotisms or to savage life, one might wisely forget
it; for the dark pages of human history are unwholesome
as well as unpleasant reading, unless the mind
be very sane in a body very sound. But those in
whose hands lie the destinies of the young and of the
beasts who serve and love us, of the weak, the friendless,
the sick and the insane, have not, alas! this
excuse for ignoring the black records of man&rsquo;s abuse
of power!</p>

<p>The records of its abuse in the savage who loads
women&rsquo;s slender shoulders with his burdens, leaves
his sick to the wayside jackal, and knocks his aged
father on the head when he is past work; the brutality
of slave-drivers, the iniquities of vice-maddened
<!-- Page 155 -->Eastern despots;&mdash;such things those who never have
to deal with them may afford to forget.</p>

<p>But men who act for those who have no natural
protectors, or have lost the power of protecting themselves,
who legislate for those who have no voice in
the making of laws, and for the brute creation, which
we win to our love and domesticate for our convenience;
who apprentice pauper boys and girls, who
meddle with the matters of weak women, sick persons,
and young children, are bound to face a far sadder
issue. That even in these days, when human love
again and again proves itself not only stronger than
death, but stronger than all the selfish hopes of life;
when the everyday manners of everyday men are
concessions of courtesy to those who have not the
strength to claim it; when children and pet animals
are spoiled to grotesqueness; when the good deeds of
priest and physician, nurse and teacher, surpass all
earthly record of them&mdash;man, as man, is no more to
be trusted with unchecked power than hitherto.</p>

<p>The secret histories of households, where power
should be safest in the hands of love; of hospitals,
of schools, of orphanages, of poorhouses, of lunatic-asylums,
of religious communities founded for <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
worship and man&rsquo;s pity, of institutions which assume
the sacred title as well as the responsibilities of Home&mdash;from
the single guardian of some rural idiot to the
<!-- Page 156 -->great society which bears the blessed Name of Jesus&mdash;have
not each and all their dark stories, their hushed-up
scandals, to prove how dire is the need of public
opinion without, and of righteous care within, that
what is well begun should be well continued?</p>

<p>If any one doubts this, let him pause on each
instance, one by one, and think of what he has seen,
and heard, and read, and known of; and he will
surely come to the conviction that human nature cannot,
even in the very service of charity, be safely
trusted with the secret exercise of irresponsible power,
and that no light can be too fierce to beat upon and
purify every spot where the weak are committed
to the tender mercies of the consciences of the
strong.</p>

<p>Mr. Crayshaw&rsquo;s conscience was not a tender one,
and very little light came into his out-of-the-way
establishment, and no check whatever upon his
cruelty. It had various effects on the different boys.
It killed one in my day, and the doctor (who had
been &ldquo;in a difficulty&rdquo; some years back, over a matter
through which Mr. Crayshaw helped him with bail
and testimony) certified to heart disease, and we all
had our pocket-handkerchiefs washed, and went to the
funeral. And Snuffy had cards printed with a black
edge, and several angels and a broken lily, and the
hymn&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><!-- Page 157 -->
&ldquo;Death has been here and borne away<br />
<span style="margin-left: -2.9em;">A brother from our side;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -2.6em;">Just in the morning of his day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: -2.7em;">As young as we he died.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>&mdash;and sent them to all the parents. But the pupils
had to pay for the stamps. And my dear mother
cried dreadfully, first because she was so sorry for the
boy, and secondly because she ever had felt uncharitably
towards Mr. Crayshaw.</p>

<p>Crayshaw&rsquo;s cruelty crushed others, it made liars
and sneaks of boys naturally honest, and it produced
in Lorraine an unchildlike despair that was almost
grand, so far was the spirit above the flesh in him.
But I think its commonest and strangest result was to
make the boys bully each other.</p>

<p>One of the least cruel of the tyrannies the big
boys put upon the little ones, sometimes bore very
hardly on those who were not strong. They used to
ride races on our backs and have desperate mounted
battles and tournaments. In many a playground and
home since then I have seen boys tilt and race, and
steeplechase, with smaller boys upon their backs, and
plenty of wholesome rough-and-tumble in the game;
and it has given me a twinge of heartache to think
how, even when we were at play, Crayshaw&rsquo;s baneful
spirit cursed us with its example, so that the big and
strong could not be happy except at the expense of
the little and weak.</p>

<p><!-- Page 158 -->For it was the big ones who rode the little ones,
with neatly-cut ash-sticks and clumsy spurs. I can
see them now, with the thin legs of the small boys
tottering under them, like a young donkey overridden
by a coal-heaver.</p>

<p>I was a favourite horse, for I was active and
nimble, and (which was more to the point) well made.
It was the shambling, ill-proportioned lads who
suffered most. The biggest boy in school rode me,
as a rule, but he was not at all a bad bully, so I was
lucky. He never spurred me, and he boasted of my
willingness and good paces. I am sure he did not
know, I don&rsquo;t suppose he ever stopped to think,
how bad it was for me, or what an aching lump of
prostration I felt when it was over. The day I
fainted after winning a steeplechase, he turned a
bucket of cold water over me, and as this roused me
into a tingling vitality of pain, he was quite proud of
his treatment, and told me nothing brought a really
good horse round after a hard day like a bucket of
clean water. And (so much are we the creatures of
our conditions!) I remember feeling something approaching
to satisfaction at the reflection that I had
&ldquo;gone till I dropped,&rdquo; and had been brought round
after the manner of the best-conducted stables.</p>

<p>It was not that that made Jem and me run away.
(For we did run away.) Overstrain and collapse, <!-- Page 159 -->ill-usage
short of torture, hard living and short commons,
one got a certain accustomedness to, according to the
merciful law which within certain limits makes a
second nature for us out of use and wont. The one
pain that knew no pause, and allowed of no revival,
the evil that overbore us, mind and body, was the
evil of constant dread. Upon us little boys fear lay
always, and the terror of it was that it was uncertain.
What would come next, and from whom, we never
knew.</p>

<p>It was I who settled we should run away. I did
it the night that Jem gave in, and would do nothing
but cry noiselessly into his sleeve and wish he was
dead. So I settled it and told Lorraine. I wanted
him to come too, but he would not. He pretended
that he did not care, and he said he had nowhere to
go to. But he got into Snuffy&rsquo;s very own room at
daybreak whilst we stood outside and heard him
snoring; and very loud he must have snored too, for
I could hear my heart thumping so I should not have
thought I could have heard anything else. And
Lorraine took the back-door key off the drawers, and
let us out, and took it back again. He feared nothing.
There was a walnut-tree by the gate, and Jem said,
&ldquo;Suppose we do our faces like gipsies, so that nobody
may know us.&rdquo; (For Jem was terribly frightened of
being taken back.) So we found some old bits of
<!-- Page 160 -->peel and rubbed our cheeks, but we dared not linger
long over it, and I said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get further on,
and we can hide if we hear steps or wheels.&rdquo; So we
took each other&rsquo;s hands, and for nearly a mile we ran
as hard as we could go, looking back now and then
over our shoulders, like the picture of Christian and
Hopeful running away from the Castle of Giant
Despair.</p>

<p>We were particularly afraid of the milkman, for
milkmen drive about early, and he had taken a
runaway boy back to Crayshaw&rsquo;s years before, and
Snuffy gave him five shillings. They said he once
helped another boy to get away, but it was a big one,
who gave him his gold watch. He would do anything
if you paid him. Jem and I had each a little
bundle in a handkerchief, but nothing in them that
the milkman would have cared for. We managed
very well, for we got behind a wall when he went by,
and I felt so much cheered up I thought we should
get home that day, far as it was. But when we got
back into the road, I found that Jem was limping, for
Snuffy had stamped on his foot when Jem had had it
stuck out beyond the desk, when he was writing; and
the running had made it worse, and at last he sat
down by the roadside, and said I was to go on home
and send back for him. It was not very likely I
would leave him to the chance of being pursued by
<!-- Page 161 -->Mr. Crayshaw; but there he sat, and I thought I
never should have persuaded him to get on my back,
for good-natured as he is, Jem is as obstinate as a pig.
But I said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of my having been first
horse with the heaviest weight in school, if I can&rsquo;t
carry you?&rdquo; So he got up and I carried him a long
way, and then a cart overtook us, and we got a lift
home. And they knew us quite well, which shows how
little use walnut-juice is, and it is disgusting to get off.</p>

<p>I think, as it happened, it was very unfortunate
that we had discoloured our faces; for though my
mother was horrified at our being so thin and
pinched-looking, my father said that of course we
looked frights with brown daubs all over our cheeks
and necks. But then he never did notice people
looking ill. He was very angry indeed, at first, about
our running away, and would not listen to what we
said. He was angry too with my dear mother,
because she believed us, and called Snuffy a bad
man and a brute. And he ordered the dog-cart to
be brought round, and said that Martha was to give
us some breakfast, and that we might be thankful to
get that instead of a flogging, for that when <i>he</i> ran
away from school to escape a thrashing, his father
gave him one thrashing while the dog-cart was being
brought round, and drove him straight back to school,
where the school-master gave him another.</p>

<p><!-- Page 162 -->&ldquo;And a very good thing for me,&rdquo; said my father,
buttoning his coat, whilst my mother and Martha
went about crying, and Jem and I stood silent. If
we were to go back, the more we told, the worse
would be Snuffy&rsquo;s revenge. An unpleasant hardness
was beginning to creep over me. &ldquo;The next time I
run away,&rdquo; was my thought, &ldquo;I shall not run home.&rdquo;
But with this came a rush of regret for Jem&rsquo;s sake.
I knew that Crayshaw&rsquo;s, did more harm to him
than to me, and almost involuntarily I put my arms
round him, thinking that if they would only let him
stay, I could go back and bear anything, like Lewis
Lorraine. Jem had been crying, and when he hid
his face on my shoulder, and leaned against me, I
thought it was for comfort, but he got heavier and
heavier, till I called out, and he rolled from my arms
and was caught in my father&rsquo;s. He had been standing
about on the bad foot, and pain and weariness
and hunger and fright overpowered him, and he had
fainted.</p>

<p>The dog-cart was counter-ordered, and Jem was
put to bed, and Martha served me a breakfast that
would have served six full-grown men. I ate far
more than satisfied me, but far less than satisfied
Martha, who seemed to hope that cold fowl and
boiled eggs, fried bacon and pickled beef, plain cakes
and currant cakes, jam and marmalade, buttered
<!-- Page 163 -->toast, strong tea and unlimited sugar and yellow
cream, would atone for the past in proportion to the
amount I ate, if it did not fatten me under her eyes.
I really think I spent the rest of the day in stupor.
I am sure it was not till the following morning that
I learned the decision to which my father had come
about us.</p>

<p>Jem was too obviously ill to be anywhere at
present but at home; and my father decided that
he would not send him back to Crayshaw&rsquo;s at all, but
to a much more expensive school in the south of
England, to which the parson of our parish was
sending one of his sons. I was to return to Crayshaw&rsquo;s
at once; he could not afford the expensive
school for us both, and Jem was the eldest. Besides
which, he was not going to countenance rebellion in
any school to which he sent his sons, or to insult a
man so highly recommended to him as Mr. Crayshaw
had been. There certainly seemed to have been
some severity, and the boys seemed to be a very
rough lot; but Jem would fight, and if he gave he
must take. His great-grandfather was just the same,
and <i>he</i> fought the Putney Pet when he was five-and-twenty,
and his parents thought he was sitting quietly
at his desk in Fetter Lane.</p>

<p>I loved Jem too well to be jealous of him, but I
was not the less conscious of the tender tone in which
<!-- Page 164 -->my father always spoke even of his faults, and of the
way it stiffened and cooled when he added that I was
not so ready with my fists, but that I was as fond of
my own way as Jem was of a fight; but that setting
up for being unlike other people didn&rsquo;t do for school
life, and that the Woods had done me no kindness by
making a fool of me. He added, however, that he
should request Mr. Crayshaw, as a personal favour,
that I should receive no punishment for running
away, as I had suffered sufficiently already.</p>

<p>We had told very little of the true history of
Crayshaw&rsquo;s before Jem fainted, and I felt no disposition
to further confidences. I took as cheerful
a farewell of my mother as I could, for her sake; and
put on a good deal of swagger and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; to
console Jem. He said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as plucky as Lorraine,&rdquo;
and then his eyes shut again. He was too ill to think
much, and I kissed his head and left him. After
which I got stoutly into the dog-cart, and we drove
back up the dreary hills down which Jem and I had
run away.</p>

<p>That Snuffy was bland to cringing before my father
did not give me hope that I should escape his direst
revenge; and the expression of Lorraine&rsquo;s face showed
me, by its sympathy, what <i>he</i> expected. But we were
both wrong, and for reasons which we then knew
nothing about.</p>

<p><!-- Page 165 -->Cruelty was, as I have said, Mr. Crayshaw&rsquo;s ruling
passion, but it was not his only vice. There was a
whispered tradition that he had once been in jail for a
misuse of his acquirements in the art of penmanship;
and if you heard his name cropping up in the confidential
conversation of such neighbours as small
farmers, the postman, the parish overseer, and the
like, it was sure to be linked with unpleasingly suggestive
expressions, such as&mdash;&ldquo;a dirty bit of business,&rdquo; &ldquo;a
nasty job that,&rdquo; &ldquo;an awkward affair,&rdquo; &ldquo;very near got
into trouble,&rdquo; &ldquo;a bit of bother about it, but Driver and
Quills pulled him through; theirs isn&rsquo;t a nice business,
and they&rsquo;re men of t&rsquo; same feather as Crayshaw,
so I reckon they&rsquo;re friends.&rdquo; Many such hints have
I heard, for the &lsquo;White Lion&rsquo; was next door to the
sweet-shop, and in summer, refreshment of a sober
kind, with conversation to match, was apt to be enjoyed
on the benches outside. The good wives of the
neighbourhood used no such euphuisms as their more
prudent husbands, when they spoke of Crayshaw&rsquo;s.
Indeed one of the whispered anecdotes of Snuffy&rsquo;s
past was of a hushed-up story that was just saved
from becoming a scandal, but in reference to which
Mr. Crayshaw was even more narrowly saved from a
crowd of women who had taken the too-tardy law into
their own hands. I remember myself the retreat of
an unpaid washerwoman from the back premises of
<!-- Page 166 -->Crayshaw&rsquo;s on one occasion, and the unmistakable
terms in which she expressed her opinions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me! I know Crayshaw&rsquo;s well enough;
such folks is a curse to a country-side, but judgment
overtakes &rsquo;em at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judgment,&rdquo; as the good woman worded it, kept
threatening Mr. Crayshaw long before it overtook him,
as it is apt to disturb scoundrels who keep a hypocritical
good name above their hidden misdeeds. As
it happened, at the very time Jem and I ran away
from him, Mr. Crayshaw himself was living in terror of
one or two revelations, and to be deserted by two of
his most respectably connected boys was an ill-timed
misfortune. The countenance my father had been so
mistaken as to afford to his establishment was very
important to him, for we were the only pupils from
within fifty miles, and our parents&rsquo; good word constituted
an &ldquo;unexceptionable reference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus it was that Snuffy pleaded humbly (but in
vain) for the return of Jem, and that he not only
promised that I should not suffer, but to my amazement
kept his word.</p>

<p>Judgment lingered over the head of Crayshaw&rsquo;s for
two years longer, and I really think my being there
had something to do with maintaining its tottering
reputation. I was almost the only lad in the school
whose parents were alive and at hand and in a good
<!-- Page 167 -->position, and my father&rsquo;s name stifled scandal. Most
of the others were orphans, being cheaply educated by
distant relatives or guardians, or else the sons of poor
widows who were easily bamboozled by Snuffy&rsquo;s fluent
letters, and the religious leaflets which it was his
custom to enclose. (In several of these cases, he was
&ldquo;managing&rdquo; the poor women&rsquo;s &ldquo;affairs&rdquo; for them.)
One or two boys belonged to people living abroad.
Indeed, the worst bully in the school was a half-caste,
whose smile, when he showed his gleaming teeth,
boded worse than any other boy&rsquo;s frown. He was a
wonderful acrobat, and could do extraordinary tricks
of all sorts. My being nimble and ready made me
very useful to him as a confederate in the exhibitions
which his intense vanity delighted to give on half-holidays,
and kept me in his good graces till I was
old enough to take care of myself. Oh, how every
boy who dreaded him applauded at these entertainments!
And what dangerous feats I performed, every
other fear being lost in the fear of him! I owe him
no grudge for what he forced me to do (though I
have had to bear real fire without flinching when he
failed in a conjuring trick, which should only have
simulated the real thing); what I learned from him
has come in so useful since, that I forgive him all.</p>

<p>I was there for two years longer. Snuffy bullied
me less, and hated me the more. I knew it, and he
<!-- Page 168 -->knew that I knew it. It was a hateful life, but I am
sure the influence of a good home holds one up in
very evil paths. Every time we went back to our
respective schools my father gave us ten shillings, and
told us to mind our books, and my mother kissed us
and made us promise we would say our prayers
every day. I could not bear to break my promise,
though I used to say them in bed (the old form we
learnt from her), and often in such a very unfit frame
of mind, that they were what it is very easy to call
&ldquo;a mockery.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">God</span> knows (Who alone knows the conditions
under which each soul blunders and spells on through
life&rsquo;s hard lessons) if they were a mockery. <i>I</i> know
they were unworthy to be offered to Him, but that the
habit helped to keep me straight I am equally sure.
Then I had a good home to go to during the holidays.
That was everything, and it is in all humbleness that
I say that I do not think the ill experiences of those
years degraded me much. I managed to keep some
truth and tenderness about me; and I am thankful to
remember that I no more cringed to Crayshaw than
Lorraine did, and that though I stayed there till I was
a big boy, I never maltreated a little one.</p>

</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Judgement</span> came at last. During my first holidays I
had posted a letter from Lewis Lorraine to the uncle
in India to whom he had before endeavoured to
appeal. The envelope did not lack stamps, but the
address was very imperfect, and it was many months
in reaching him. He wrote a letter, which Lewis
never received, Mr. Crayshaw probably knew why.
But twelve months after that Colonel Jervois came to
England, and he lost no time in betaking himself to
Crayshaw&rsquo;s. From Crayshaw&rsquo;s he came to my father,
the only &ldquo;unexceptionable reference&rdquo; left to Snuffy
to put forward.</p>

<p>The Colonel came with a soldier&rsquo;s promptness, and,
with the utmost courtesy of manner, went straight to
<!-- Page 170 -->the point. His life had not accustomed him to our
neighbourly unwillingness to interfere with anything
that did not personally concern us, nor to the prudent
patience with which country folk will wink long at
local evils. In the upshot what he asked was what
my mother had asked three years before. Had my
father personal knowledge or good authority for believing
the school to be a well-conducted one, and Mr.
Crayshaw a fit man for his responsible post? Had he
ever heard rumours to the man&rsquo;s discredit?</p>

<p>Replies that must do for a wife will not always
answer a man who puts the same questions. My
great-grandfather&rsquo;s memory was not evoked on this
occasion, and my father frankly confessed that his
personal knowledge of Crayshaw&rsquo;s was very small, and
that the man on whose recommendation he had sent
us to school there had just proved to be a rascal and
a swindler. Our mother had certainly heard rumours
of severity, but he had regarded her maternal anxiety
as excessive, etc., etc. In short, my dear father saw
that he had been wrong, and confessed it, and was
now as ready as the Colonel to expose Snuffy&rsquo;s
misdeeds.</p>

<p>No elaborate investigation was needed. An
attack once made on Mr. Crayshaw&rsquo;s hollow reputation,
it cracked on every side; first hints crept out,
then scandals flew. The Colonel gave no quarter,
<!-- Page 171 -->and he did not limit his interest to his own
nephew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A widow&rsquo;s son, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; so he said to my mother,
bowing over her hand as he led her in to dinner,
in a style to which we were quite unaccustomed; &ldquo;a
widow&rsquo;s son, ma&rsquo;am, should find a father in every
honest man who can assist him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tide having turned against Snuffy, his friends
(of the Driver and Quills type) turned with it. But
they gained nothing, for one morning he got up as
early as we had done, and ran away, and I never
heard of him again. And before nightfall the neighbours,
who had so long tolerated his wickedness,
broke every pane of glass in his windows.</p>

<p>During all this, Lewis Lorraine and his uncle
stayed at our house. The Colonel spent his time
between holding indignant investigations, writing
indignant letters (which he allowed us to seal with
his huge signet), and walking backwards and forwards
to the town to buy presents for the little
boys.</p>

<p>When Snuffy ran away, and the school was left
to itself, Colonel Jervois strode off to the nearest
farm, requisitioned a waggon, and having packed
the boys into it, bought loaves and milk enough
to breakfast them all, and transported the whole
twenty-eight to our door. He left four with my
<!-- Page 172 -->mother, and marched off with the rest. The Woods
took in a large batch, and in the course of the
afternoon he had for love or money quartered
them all. He betrayed no nervousness in dealing
with numbers, in foraging for supplies, or in asking
for what he wanted. Whilst other people had been
doubting whether it might not &ldquo;create unpleasantness&rdquo;
to interfere in this case and that, the Colonel
had fought each boy&rsquo;s battle, and seen most of
them off on their homeward journeys. He was
used to dealing with men, and with emergencies,
and it puzzled him when my Uncle Henry consulted
his law-books and advised caution, and my
father saw his agent on farm business, whilst the
fate of one of Crayshaw&rsquo;s victims yet hung in the
balance.</p>

<p>When all was over the Colonel left us, and took
Lewis with him, and his departure raised curiously
mixed feelings of regret and relief.</p>

<p>He had quite won my mother&rsquo;s heart, chiefly by
his energy and tenderness for the poor boys, and
partly by his kindly courtesy and deference towards
her. Indeed all ladies liked him&mdash;all, that is, who
knew him. Before they came under the influence
of his pleasantness and politeness, he shared the
half-hostile reception to which any person or anything
that was foreign to our daily experience was
<!-- Page 173 -->subjected in our neighbourhood. So that the first
time Colonel Jervois appeared in our pew, Mrs.
Simpson (the wife of a well-to-do man of business
who lived near us) said to my mother after church,
&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve got one of the military with you,&rdquo; and
her tone was more critical than congratulatory.
But when my mother, with unconscious diplomacy,
had kept her to luncheon, and the Colonel had
handed her to her seat, and had stroked his
moustache, and asked in his best manner if she
meant to devote her son to the service of his
country, Mrs. Simpson undid her bonnet-strings,
fairly turned her back on my father, and was quite
unconscious when Martha handed the potatoes; and
she left us wreathed in smiles, and resolved that
Mr. Simpson should buy their son Horace a commission
instead of taking him into the business.
Mr. Simpson did not share her views, and I believe
he said some rather nasty things about swaggering,
and not having one sixpence to rub against another.
And Mrs. Simpson (who was really devoted to
Horace and could hardly bear him out of her sight)
reflected that it was possible to get shot as well as
to grow a moustache if you went into the army; but
she still maintained that she should always remember
the Colonel as a thorough gentleman, and a wonderful
judge of the character of boys.</p>

<p><!-- Page 174 -->The Colonel made great friends with the Woods,
and he was deeply admired by our rector, who,
like many parsons, had a very military heart, and
delighted in exciting tales of the wide world which
he could never explore. It was perhaps natural
that my father should hardly be devoted to a
stranger who had practically reproached his negligence,
but the one thing that did draw him towards
the old Indian officer was his habit of early rising.
My father was always up before any of us, but he
generally found the Colonel out before him, enjoying
the early hours of the day as men who have
lived in hot climates are accustomed to do. They
used to come in together in very pleasant moods
to breakfast; but with the post-bag Lorraine&rsquo;s
uncle was sure to be moved to voluble indignation,
or pity, or to Utopian plans to which my father
listened with puzzled impatience. He did not understand
the Colonel, which was perhaps not to be
wondered at.</p>

<p>His moral courage had taken away our breath,
and physical courage was stamped upon his outward
man. If he was anything he was manly. It
was because he was in some respects very womanly
too, that he puzzled my father&rsquo;s purely masculine
brain. The mixture, and the vehemence of the
mixture, were not in his line. He would have
<!-- Page 175 -->turned &ldquo;Crayshaw&rsquo;s&rdquo; matters over in his own mind
as often as hay in a wet season before grappling
with the whole bad business as the Colonel had
done. And on the other hand, it made him feel
uncomfortable and almost ashamed to see tears
standing in the old soldier&rsquo;s eyes as he passionately
blamed himself for what had been suffered by &ldquo;my
sister&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servants one and all adored Colonel Jervois.
They are rather acute judges of good breeding, and
men and maids were at one on the fact that he was
a visitor who conferred social distinction on the
establishment. They had decided that we should
&ldquo;dine late so long as The Gentleman&rdquo; was with us,
whilst my mother was thinking how to break so
weighty an innovation to such valuable servants.
They served him with alacrity, and approved of his
brief orders and gracious thanks. The Colonel did
unheard-of things with impunity&mdash;threw open his
bed-room shutters at night, and more than once
unbarred and unbolted the front door to go outside
for a late cigar. Nothing puzzled Martha more than
the nattiness with which he put all the bolts and
bars back into their places, as if he had been used
to the door as long as she had.</p>

<p>Indeed he had all that power of making himself
at home, which is most fully acquired by having
<!-- Page 176 -->had to provide for yourself in strange places, but
he carried it too far.</p>

<p>One day he penetrated into the kitchen (having
previously been rummaging the kitchen-garden) and
insisted upon teaching our cook how to make curry.
The lesson was much needed, and it was equally
well intended, but it was a mistake. Everything
cannot be carried by storm, whatever the military
may think. Jane said, &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; at every point
that approached to a pause in the Colonel&rsquo;s ample
instructions, but she never moved her eyes from the
magnificent moustache which drooped above the
stew-pan, nor her thoughts from the one idea produced
by the occasion&mdash;that The Gentleman had
caught her without her cap. In short our curries
were no worse, and no better, in consequence of the
shock to kitchen etiquette (for that was all) which she
received.</p>

<p>And yet we modified our household ways for
him, as they were never modified for any one else.
On Martha&rsquo;s weekly festival for cleaning the bedrooms
(and if a room was occupied for a night,
she scrubbed after the intruder as if he had brought
the plague in his portmanteau) the smartest visitor
we ever entertained had to pick his or her way
through the upper regions of the house, where soap
and soda were wafted on high and unexpected
<!-- Page 177 -->breezes along passages filled with washstands and
clothes-baskets, cane-seated chairs and baths, mops,
pails and brooms. But the Colonel had &ldquo;given
such a jump&rdquo; on meeting a towel-horse at large
round a sharp corner, and had seemed so uncomfortable
on finding everything that he thought was
inside his room turned outside, that for that week
Martha left the lower part of the house uncleaned,
and did not turn either the dining or drawing rooms
into the hall on their appointed days. She had her
revenge when he was gone.</p>

<p>On the day of his departure, my lamentations
had met with the warmest sympathy as I stirred
toffy over Jane&rsquo;s kitchen fire, whilst Martha lingered
with the breakfast things, after a fashion very unusual
with her, and gazed at the toast-rack and said, &ldquo;the
Colonel had eaten nothing of a breakfast to travel
on.&rdquo; But next morning, I met her in another mood.
It was a mood to which we were not strangers,
though it did not often occur. In brief, Martha
(like many another invaluable domestic) &ldquo;had a
temper of her own&rdquo;; but to do her justice her ill
feelings generally expended themselves in a rage
for work, and in taking as little ease herself as she
allowed to other people. I knew what it meant
when I found her cleaning the best silver when she
ought to have been eating her breakfast; but my
<!-- Page 178 -->head was so full of the Colonel, that I could not
help talking about him, even if the temptation to
tease Martha had not been overwhelming. No
reply could I extract; only once, as she passed
swiftly to the china cupboard, with the whole
Crown Derby tea and coffee service on one big
tray (the Colonel had praised her coffee), I heard
her mutter&mdash;&ldquo;Soldiers is very upsetting.&rdquo; Certainly,
considering what she did in the way of scolding,
scouring, blackleading, polishing and sand-papering
that week, it was not Martha&rsquo;s fault if we did not
&ldquo;get straight again,&rdquo; furniture and feelings. I&rsquo;ve
heard her say that Calais sand would &ldquo;fetch anything
off,&rdquo; and I think it had fetched the Colonel
off her heart by the time that the cleaning was
done.</p>

<p>It had no such effect on mine. Lewis Lorraine
himself did not worship his uncle more devoutly
than I. Colonel Jervois had given me a new ideal.
It was possible, then, to be enthusiastic without
being unmanly; to live years out of England, and
come back more patriotic than many people who
stayed comfortably at home; to go forth into the
world and be the simpler as well as the wiser, the
softer as well as the stronger for the experience?
So it seemed. And yet Lewis had told me, with
such tears as Snuffy never made him shed, how
<!-- Page 179 -->tender his uncle was to his unworthiness, what
allowances he made for the worst that Lewis could
say of himself, and what hope he gave him of a good
and happy future.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He cried as bad as I did,&rdquo; Lewis said, &ldquo;and
begged me to forgive him for having trusted so
much to my other guardian. Do you know, Jack,
Snuffy regularly forged a letter like my handwriting,
to answer that one Uncle Eustace wrote,
which he kept back? He might well do such good
copies, and write the year of Our Lord with a swan
at the end of the last flourish! And you remember
what we heard about his having been in prison&mdash;but,
oh, dear! I don&rsquo;t want to remember. He says
I am to forget, and he forbade me to talk about
Crayshaw&rsquo;s, and said I was not to trouble my head
about anything that had happened there. He kept
saying, &lsquo;Forget, my boy, forget! Say <span class="smcap">God</span> help me,
and look forward. While there&rsquo;s life there&rsquo;s always
the chance of a better life for every one. Forget!
forget!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lewis departed with his uncle. Charlie went
for two nights to the moors. Jem&rsquo;s holidays had
not begun, and in our house we were &ldquo;cleaning
down&rdquo; after the Colonel as if he had been the
sweeps.</p>

<p>I went to old Isaac for sympathy. He had
<!-- Page 180 -->become very rheumatic the last two years, but he
was as intelligent as ever, and into his willing ear
I poured all that I could tell of my hero, and
much that I only imagined.</p>

<p>His sympathy met me more than half-way. The
villagers as a body were unbounded in their approval
of the Colonel, and Mrs. Irvine was even greedier
than old Isaac for every particular I could impart
respecting him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a <i>handsome</i> gentleman,&rdquo; said the bee-master&rsquo;s
wife, &ldquo;and he passed us (my neighbour,
Mrs. Mettam, and me) as near, sir, as I am to you,
with a gold-headed stick in his hand, and them lads
following after him, for all the world like the Good
Shepherd and his flock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I managed not to laugh, and old Isaac added,
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a many in this village, sir, would have been
glad to have taken the liberty of expressing themselves
to the Colonel, and a <i>depitation</i> did get as far as your
father&rsquo;s gates one night, but they turned bashful and
come home again. And I know, for one, Master
Jack, that if me and my missus had had a room fit to
offer one of them poor young gentlemen, I&rsquo;d have
given a week&rsquo;s wage to do it, and the old woman
would have been happy to her dying day.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fact that my father had sent me back against
my will to a school where I had suffered so much and
learnt so little, ought perhaps to have drawn us together
when he discovered his mistake. Unfortunately
it did not. He was deeply annoyed with himself
for having been taken in by Snuffy, but he transferred
some of this annoyance to me, on grounds which cut
me to the soul, and which I fear I resented so much
that I was not in a mood that was favourable to
producing a better understanding between us. The
injustice which I felt so keenly was, that my father
reproached me with having what he called &ldquo;kept
him in the dark&rdquo; about the life at Crayshaw&rsquo;s. At
my age I must have seen how wicked the man and
his system were.</p>

<p><!-- Page 182 -->I reminded him that I had run away from them
once, and had told all that I dared, but that he would
not hear me then. He would not hear me now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to discuss the subject. It is a very
painful one,&rdquo; he said (and I believe it was as physically
distressing to him as the thought of Cripple
Charlie&rsquo;s malformation). &ldquo;I have no wish to force
your confidence when it is too late,&rdquo; he added (and it
was this which I felt to be so hard). &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame
you; you have other friends who suit you better, but
you have never been fully open with me. All I can
say is, if Mr. Wood was better informed than I have
been, and did not acquaint me, he has behaved in a
manner which&mdash;&mdash; There&mdash;don&rsquo;t speak! we&rsquo;ll dismiss
the subject. You have suffered enough, if you
have not acted as I should have expected you to act.
I blame myself unutterably, and I hope I see my way
to such a comfortable and respectable start in life for
you that these three years in that vile place may not
be to your permanent disadvantage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was just opening my lips to thank him, when he
got up and went to his tall desk, where he took a pinch
of snuff, and then added as he turned away, &ldquo;Thank
<span class="smcap">God</span> I have <i>one</i> son who is frank with his father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My lips were sealed in an instant. This, then,
was my reward for that hard journey of escape, with
Jem on my back, which had only saved him; for
<!-- Page 183 -->having stifled envy in gladness for his sake, when (in
those bits of our different holidays which overlapped
each other) I saw and felt the contrast between our
opportunities; for having suffered my harder lot in
silence that my mother might not fret, when I felt
certain that my father would not interfere! My heart
beat as if it would have pumped the tears into my
eyes by main force, but I kept them back, and said
steadily enough, &ldquo;Is that all, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My father did not look up, but he nodded his
head and said, &ldquo;Yes; you may go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I went he called me back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to the farm this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To my own infinite annoyance I blushed as I
answered, &ldquo;I was going to sit with Charlie a bit,
unless you have any objection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. I only asked for information. I
have no wish to interfere with any respectable friends
you may be disposed to give your confidence to. But
I should like it to be understood that either your
mother or I must have some knowledge of your
movements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother knew quite well I was going!&rdquo; I exclaimed
&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve got a parcel to take to Mrs.
Wood from her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good. There&rsquo;s no occasion to display
temper. Shut the door after you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- Page 184 -->I shut it very gently. (If three years at Crayshaw&rsquo;s
had taught me nothing else, it had taught me
much self-control.) Then I got away to the first
hiding-place I could find, and buried my head upon
my arms. Would not a beating from Snuffy have
been less hard to bear? Surely sore bones from those
one despises are not so painful as a sore heart from
those one loves.</p>

<p>Our household affections were too sound at the
core for the mere fact of displeasing my father not to
weigh heavily on my soul. But I could not help
defending myself in my own mind against what I
knew to be injustice.</p>

<p>Jem &ldquo;frank with his father&rdquo;? Well he might be,
when our father&rsquo;s partiality met him half-way at every
turn. <i>That</i> was no fancy of mine. I had the clearest
of childish remembrances of an occasion when I
wanted to do something which our farming-man
thought my father would not approve, and how when
I urged the fact that Jem had already done it with
impunity, he shook his head wiseacrely, and said,
&ldquo;Aye, aye, Master Jack. But ye know they say some
folks may steal a horse, when other folks mayn&rsquo;t look
over the hedge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vagueness of &ldquo;some folks&rdquo; and &ldquo;other folks&rdquo;
had left the proverb dark to my understanding when I
heard it, but I remembered it till I understood it.</p>

<p><!-- Page 185 -->I never was really jealous of Jem. He was far
too good-natured and unspoilt, and I was too fond of
him. Besides which, if the mental tone of our country
lives was at rather a dull level, it was also wholesomely
unfavourable to the cultivation of morbid grievances,
or the dissection of one&rsquo;s own hurt feelings. If I had
told anybody about me, from my dear mother down
to our farming-man, that I was misunderstood and
wanted sympathy, I should probably have been answered
that many a lad of my age was homeless and
wanted boots. As a matter of reasoning the reply
would have been defective, but for practical purposes
it would have been much to the point. And it is fair
to this rough-and-ready sort of philosophy to defend it
from a common charge of selfishness. It was not
that I should have been the happier because another
lad was miserable, but that an awakened sympathy
with his harder fate would tend to dwarf egotistic
absorption in my own. Such considerations, in short,
are no justification of those who are responsible for
needless evil or neglected good, but they are handy
helps to those who suffer from them, and who feel
sadly sorry for themselves.</p>

<p>I am sure the early-begun and oft-reiterated teaching
of daily thankfulness for daily blessing was very
useful to me at Crayshaw&rsquo;s and has been useful to me
ever since. With my dear mother herself it was
<!-- Page 186 -->merely part of that pure and constant piety which ran
through her daily life, like a stream that is never
frozen and never runs dry. In me it had no such
grace, but it was an early-taught good habit (as instinctive
as any bodily habit) to feel&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m
thankful things are not so with me;&rdquo; as quickly as
&ldquo;Ah, it might have been thus!&rdquo; Looking at the fates
and fortunes and dispositions of other boys, I had,
even at Snuffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;much to be thankful for&rdquo; as well as
much to endure, and it was a good thing for me that
I could balance the two. For if the grace of thankfulness
does not solve the riddles of life, it lends a
willing shoulder to its common burdens.</p>

<p>I certainly had needed all my philosophy at home
as well as at school. It was hard to come back, one
holiday-time after another, ignorant except for books
that I devoured in the holidays, and for my own independent
studies of maps, and an old geography
book at Snuffy&rsquo;s from which I was allowed to give
lessons to the lowest form; rough in looks, and dress,
and manners (I knew it, but it requires some self-respect
even to use a nail-brush, and self-respect was
next door to impossible at Crayshaw&rsquo;s); and with my
north-country accent deepened, and my conversation
disfigured by slang which, not being fashionable slang,
was as inadmissible as thieves&rsquo; lingo; it was hard, I
say, to come back thus, and meet dear old Jem, and
<!-- Page 187 -->generally one at least of his school-fellows whom he
had asked to be allowed to invite&mdash;both of them well
dressed, well cared for, and well mannered, full of
games that were not in fashion at Crayshaw&rsquo;s, and
slang as &ldquo;correct&rdquo; as it was unintelligible.</p>

<p>Jem&rsquo;s heart was as true to me as ever, but he was
not so thin-skinned as I am. He was never a fellow
who worried himself much about anything, and I
don&rsquo;t think it struck him I could feel hurt or lonely.
He would say, &ldquo;I say, Jack, what a beastly way your
hair is cut. I wish Father would let you come to our
school:&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it was a dirty trick&mdash;say it
was a beastly chouse, or something of that sort.
We&rsquo;re awfully particular about talking at &mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s, and
I don&rsquo;t want Cholmondley to hear you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jem was wonderfully polished-up himself, and as
pugnacious on behalf of all the institutions of his
school as he had once been about our pond. I got
my hair as near right as one cutting and the town
hair-cutter could bring it, and mended my manners
and held my own with good temper. When it came
to feats of skill or endurance, I more than held my
own. Indeed, I so amazed one very &ldquo;swell&rdquo; little
friend of Jem&rsquo;s whose mother (a titled lady) had
allowed him to spend part of the summer holidays
with Jem for change of air, that he vowed I must go
and stay with him in the winter, and do juggler and
<!-- Page 188 -->acrobat at their Christmas theatricals. But he may
have reported me as being rough as well as ready, for
her ladyship never ratified the invitation. Not that I
would have left home at Christmas, and not that I
lacked pleasure in the holidays. But other fashions
of games and speech and boyish etiquette lay between
me and Jem; hospitality, if not choice, kept him
closely with his school-fellows, and neither they nor he
had part in the day-dreams of my soul.</p>

<p>For the spell of the Penny Numbers had not
grown weaker as I grew older. In the holidays I
came back to them as to friends. At school they
made the faded maps on Snuffy&rsquo;s dirty walls alive with
visions, and many a night as I lay awake with pain
and over-weariness in the stifling dormitory, my
thoughts took refuge not in dreams of home nor in
castles of the air, but in phantom ships that sailed for
ever round the world.</p>

<p>The day of the interview with my father I roused
myself from my grievances to consider a more
practical question. Why should I not go to sea?
No matter whose fault it was, there was no doubt
that I was ill-educated, and that I did not please my
father as Jem did. On the other hand I was strong
and hardy, nimble and willing to obey; and I had
roughed it enough, in all conscience. I must have ill
luck indeed, if I lit upon a captain more cruel than
<!-- Page 189 -->Mr. Crayshaw. I did not know exactly how it was to
be accomplished, but I knew enough to know that I
could not aim at the Royal Navy. Of course I should
have preferred it. I had never seen naval officers, but
if they were like officers in the army, like Colonel
Jervois, for instance, it was with such a port and
bearing that I would fain have carried myself when
I grew up to be a man. I guessed, however, that
money and many other considerations might make it
impossible for me to be a midshipman; but I had
heard of boys being apprenticed to merchant-vessels,
and I resolved to ask my father if he would so
apprentice me.</p>

<p>He refused, and he accompanied his refusal with
an unfavourable commentary on my character and
conduct, which was not the less bitter because the
accusations were chiefly general.</p>

<p>This sudden fancy for the sea&mdash;well, if it were not
a sudden fancy, but a dream of my life, what a painful
instance it afforded of my habitual want of frankness!&mdash;This
long-concealed project which I had suddenly
brought to the surface&mdash;I had talked about it to my
mother years ago, had I, but it had distressed her,
and even to my father, but he had snubbed me?&mdash;then
I had been deliberately fostering aims and plans
to which I had always known that my parents would
be opposed. My father didn&rsquo;t believe a word of it.
<!-- Page 190 -->It was the old story. I must be peculiar at any price.
I must have something new to amuse me, and be unlike
the rest of the family. It was always the same.
For years I had found more satisfaction from the conversation
of a man who had spent ten years of his life
in the hulks than from that of my own father. Then
this Indian Colonel had taken my fancy, and it had
made him sick to see the womanish&mdash;he could call it
no better, the <i>weak-womanish</i>&mdash;way in which I worshipped
him. If I were a daughter instead of a son,
my caprices would distress and astonish him less. He
could have sent me to my mother, and my mother
might have sent me to my needle. In a son, from
whom he looked for manly feeling and good English
common-sense, it was painful in the extreme. Vanity,
the love of my own way, and want of candour&mdash;(my
father took a pinch of snuff between each count of the
indictment)&mdash;these were my besetting sins, and would
lead me into serious trouble. This new fad, just, too,
when he had made most favourable arrangements for
my admission into my Uncle Henry&rsquo;s office as the first
step in a prosperous career. I didn&rsquo;t know; didn&rsquo;t I?
Perhaps not. Perhaps I had been at the Woods&rsquo;
when he and my mother were speaking of it. But
now I did know. The matter was decided, and he
hoped I should profit by my opportunities. I might
go, and I was to shut the door after me.</p>

<p><!-- Page 191 -->I omit what my father said of the matter from a
religious point of view, though he accused me of flying
in the face of Providence as well as the Fifth Commandment.
The piety which kept a pure and <span class="smcap">God</span>-fearing
atmosphere about my home, and to which I
owe all the strength I have found against evil since I
left it, was far too sincere in both my parents for me
to speak of any phase of it with disrespect. Though
I may say here that I think it is to be wished that
more good people exercised judgment as well as faith
in tracing the will of Heaven in their own. Practically
I did not even then believe that I was more &ldquo;called&rdquo;
to that station of life which was to be found in Uncle
Henry&rsquo;s office, than to that station of life which I
should find on board a vessel in the Merchant Service,
and it only discredited truth in my inmost soul when
my father put his plans for my career in that light.
Just as I could not help feeling it unfair that a commandment
which might have been fairly appealed to
if I had disobeyed him, should be used against me in
argument because I disagreed with him.</p>

<p>I did disagree with him utterly. Uncle Henry&rsquo;s
office was a gloomy place, where I had had to endure
long periods of waiting as a child when my mother
took us in to the dentist, and had shopping and visiting
of uncertain length to do. Uncle Henry himself
was no favourite with me. He was harder than my
<!-- Page 192 -->father if you vexed him, and less genial when you
didn&rsquo;t. And I wanted to go to sea. But it did not
seem a light matter to me to oppose my parents, and
they were both against me. My dear mother was
thrown into the profoundest distress by the bare
notion. In her view to be at sea was merely to run
an imminent and ceaseless risk of shipwreck; and
even this jeopardy of life and limb was secondary to
the dangers that going ashore in foreign places would
bring upon my mind and morals.</p>

<p>So when my father spoke kindly to me at supper,
and said that he had arranged with Mr. Wood that I
should read with him for two hours every evening, in
preparation for my future life as an articled clerk, my
heart was softened. I thanked him gratefully, and
resolved for my own part to follow what seemed to be
the plain path of duty, though it led to Uncle Henry&rsquo;s
office, and not out into the world.</p>

<p>The capacity in which I began life in Uncle
Henry&rsquo;s office was that of office boy, and the situation
was attended in my case with many favourable conditions.
Uncle Henry wished me to sleep on the
premises, as my predecessor had done, but an accidental
circumstance led to my coming home daily,
which I infinitely preferred. This was nothing less
than an outbreak of boils all over me, upon which,
every domestic application having failed, and gallons
<!-- Page 193 -->of herb tea only making me worse, Dr. Brown was
called in, and pronounced my health in sore need of
restoration. The regimen of Crayshaw&rsquo;s was not to
be recovered from in a day, and the old doctor would
not hear of my living altogether in the town. If I
went to the office at all, he said, I must ride in early,
and ride out in the evening. So much fresh air and
exercise were imperative, and I must eat two solid
meals a day under no less careful an eye than that of
my mother.</p>

<p>She was delighted. She thought (even more than
usual) that Doctor Brown was a very Solomon in
spectacles, and I quite agreed with her. The few
words that followed gave a slight shock to her favourable
opinion of his wisdom, but I need hardly say
that it confirmed mine.</p>

<p>He had given me a kindly slap on the shoulder,
which happened at that moment to be the sorest
point in my body, and I was in no small pain from
head to foot. I only tightened my lips, but I suppose
he bethought himself of what he had done, and he
looked keenly at me and said, &ldquo;You can bear pain,
Master Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack&rsquo;s a very brave boy,&rdquo; said my dear
mother. &ldquo;Indeed, he&rsquo;s only too brave. He upset
his father and me terribly last week by wanting to go
to sea instead of to the office.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- Page 194 -->&ldquo;And much better for him, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the old
doctor, promptly; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll make a first-rate sailor, and
if Crayshaw&rsquo;s is all the schooling he&rsquo;s had, a very
indifferent clerk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I think!&rdquo; I began, but my
mother coloured crimson with distress, and I stopped,
and went after her worsted ball which she had
dropped, whilst she appealed to Doctor Brown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t say so, Doctor Brown. Jack is <i>very</i>
good, and it&rsquo;s all <i>quite</i> decided. I couldn&rsquo;t part with
him, and his father would be <i>so</i> annoyed if the
subject&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; said the doctor, pocketing his
spectacles; &ldquo;I never interfere with family affairs, and
I never repeat what I hear. The first rules of the
profession, young gentleman, and very good general
rules for anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got quite well again, and my new life began. I
rode in and out of the town every day on Rob Roy,
our red-haired pony. After tea I went to the farm to
be taught by Mr. Wood, and at every opportunity I
devoured such books as I could lay my hands on. I
fear I had very little excuse for not being contented
now. And yet I was not content.</p>

<p>It seems absurd to say that the drains had anything
to do with it, but the horrible smell which
pervaded the office added to the distastefulness of the
<!-- Page 195 -->place, and made us all feel ill and fretful, except my
uncle, and Moses Benson, the Jew clerk. He was
never ill, and he said he smelt nothing; which shows
that one may have a very big nose to very little
purpose.</p>

<p>My uncle pooh-poohed the unwholesome state of
the office, for two reasons which certainly had some
weight. The first was that he himself had been there
for five-and-twenty years without suffering by it; and
the second was, that the defects of drainage were so
radical that (the place belonging to that period of
house-building when the system of drainage was often
worse than none at all) half the premises, if not half
the street, would have to be pulled down for any
effectual remedy. So it was left as it was, and when
Mr. Burton, the head clerk, had worse headaches than
usual, he used to give me sixpence for chloride of
lime, which I distributed at my discretion, and on
those days Moses Benson used generally to say that
he &ldquo;fancied he smelt something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moses Benson was an articled clerk to my uncle,
but he had no pretensions to be considered a gentleman.
His father kept a small shop where second-hand
watches were the most obvious goods; but the
old man was said to have money, though the watches
did not seem to sell very fast, and his son had duly
qualified for his post, and had paid a good premium.
<!-- Page 196 -->Moses was only two or three years older than I, not
that I could have told anything about his age from
his looks. He was sallow, and had a big nose; his
hands were fat, his feet were small, and I think his
head was large, but perhaps his hair made it look
larger than it was, for it was thick and very black, and
though it was curly, it was not like Jem&rsquo;s; the curls
were more like short ringlets, and if he bent over his
desk they hid his forehead, and when he put his head
back to think, they lay on his coat-collar. And I
suppose it was partly because he could not smell with
his nose, that he used such very strong hair-oil, and so
much of it. It used to make his coat-collar in a
horrid state, but he always kept a little bottle of
&ldquo;scouring drops&rdquo; on the ledge of his desk, and when
it got very bad, I knelt behind him on the corner of
his stool and scoured his coat-collar with a little bit of
flannel. Not that I did it half so well as he could.
He wore very odd-looking clothes, but he took great
care of them, and was always touching them up, and
&ldquo;reviving&rdquo; his hat with one of Mrs. O&rsquo;Flannagan&rsquo;s
irons. He used to sell bottles of the scouring drops
to the other clerks, and once he got me to get my
mother to buy some. He gave me a good many little
odd jobs to do for him, but he always thanked me,
and from the beginning to the end of our acquaintance
he was invariably kind.</p>

<p><!-- Page 197 -->I remember a very odd scene that happened at
the beginning of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton (the other clerk, whose time was to
expire the following year, which was to make a
vacancy for me) was a very different man from Moses
Benson. He was respectably connected, and looked
down on &ldquo;the Jew-boy,&rdquo; but he was hot-tempered,
and rather slow-witted, and I think Moses could
manage him; and I think it was he who kept their
constant &ldquo;tiffs&rdquo; from coming to real quarrels.</p>

<p>One day, very soon after I began office-life,
Benson sent me out to get him some fancy notepaper,
and when I came back I saw the red-haired
Mr. Burton standing by the desk and looking rather
more sickly and cross than usual. I laid down the
paper and the change, and asked if Benson wanted
anything else. He thanked me exceedingly kindly,
and said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and I went out of the enclosure and
back to the corner where I had been cutting out
some newspaper extracts for my uncle. At the same
time I drew from under my overcoat which was lying
there, an old railway volume of one of Cooper&rsquo;s
novels which Charlie had lent me. I ought not to
have been reading novels in office-hours, but I had
had to stop short last night because my candle went
out just at the most exciting point, and I had had
no time to see what became of everybody before I
<!-- Page 198 -->started for town in the morning. I could bear
suspense no longer, and plunged into my book.</p>

<p>How it was in these circumstances that I heard
what the two clerks were saying, I don&rsquo;t know. They
talked constantly in these open enclosures, when they
knew I was within hearing. On this occasion I
suppose they thought I had gone out, and it was
some minutes before I discovered that they were
talking of me. Burton spoke first, and in an irritated
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You treat this young shaver precious different to
the last one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Jew spoke very softly, and with an occasional
softening of the consonants in his words. &ldquo;How
obsherving you are!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Burton snorted. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t take much observation
to see that. But I suppose you have your reasons.
You Jews are always so sly. That&rsquo;s how you get on
so, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You Gentiles,&rdquo; replied Moses (and the Jew&rsquo;s
voice had tones which gave him an infinite advantage
in retaliating scorn), &ldquo;you Gentiles would do as well
as we do if you were able to foresee and knew how to
wait. You have all the selfishness for success, my
dear, but the gifts of prophecy and patience are
wanting to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to do with your little game about
<!-- Page 199 -->the boy,&rdquo; said Burton; &ldquo;however, I suppose you can
keep your own secrets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no secrets,&rdquo; said Moses gently. &ldquo;And
if you take my advice, you never will have. If you
have no secrets, my dear, they will never be found
out. If you tell your little designs, your best friends
will be satisfied, and will not invent less creditable
ones for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they did, you&rsquo;d talk &rsquo;em down,&rdquo; said Burton
roughly. &ldquo;Short of a woman I never met such a
hand at jaw. You&rsquo;ll be in Parliament yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (&ldquo;It
is possible!&rdquo; said the Jew hastily,) &ldquo;with that long
tongue of yours. But you haven&rsquo;t told us about the
boy, for all you&rsquo;ve said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About this boy,&rdquo; said Moses, &ldquo;a proverb will be
shorter than my jaw. &lsquo;The son of the house is not
a servant for ever.&rsquo; As to the other&mdash;he was taken
for charity and dismissed for theft, is it not so?
He came from the dirt, and he went back to the
dirt. They often do. Why should I be civil to
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What reply Mr. Burton would have made to this
question I had no opportunity of judging. My uncle
called him, and he ran hastily up-stairs. And when
he had gone, the Jew came slowly out, and crossed
the office as if he were going into the street. By this
time my conscience was pricking hard, and I shoved
<!-- Page 200 -->my book under my coat and called to him: &ldquo;Mr.
Benson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; I stammered, blushing, &ldquo;but
I heard what you were saying. I did not mean to
listen. I thought you knew that I was there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of no importance,&rdquo; he said, turning away;
&ldquo;I have no secrets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I detained him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Benson! Tell me, please. You <i>were</i> talking
about me, weren&rsquo;t you? What did you mean
about the son of the house not being a servant for ever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hesitated for an instant, and then turned round
and came nearer to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true, is it not?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Next year you
may be clerk. In time you may be your uncle&rsquo;s confidential
clerk, which I should like to be myself.
You may eventually be partner, as I should like to
be; and in the long run you may succeed him, as
I should like to do. It is a good business, my
dear, a sound business, a business of which much,
very much, more might be made. You might die
rich, very rich. You might be mayor, you might be
Member, you might&mdash;but what is the use? <i>You will
not.</i> You do not see it, though I am telling you.
You will not wait for it, though it would come.
What is that book you hid when I came in?&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- Page 201 -->&ldquo;It is about North American Indians,&rdquo; said I,
dragging it forth. &ldquo;I am very sorry, but I left off
last night at such an exciting bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Jew was thumbing the pages, with his black
ringlets close above them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Novels in office-hours!&rdquo; said he; but he was
very good-natured about it, and added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve one or
two books at home, if you&rsquo;re fond of this kind of
reading, and will promise me not to forget your
duties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I promise!&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put them under my desk in the corner,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;indeed, I would part with some of them for a
trifle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thanked him warmly, but what he had said was
still hanging in my mind, and I added, &ldquo;Are there real
prophets among the Jews now-a-days, Mr. Benson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will make nothing by it, if there are,&rdquo; said
he; and there was a tone of mysteriousness in his
manner of speaking which roused my romantic curiosity.
&ldquo;A few of ush (very few, my dear!) mould
our own fates, and the lives of the rest are moulded
by what men have within them rather than by what
they find without. If there were a true prophet in
every market-place to tell each man of his future, it
would not alter the destinies of seven men in thish wide
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- Page 202 -->As Moses spoke the swing door was pushed open,
and one of my uncle&rsquo;s clients entered. He was an
influential man, and a very tall one. The Jew bent
his ringlets before him, almost beneath his elbow, and
slipped out as he came in.</p>

</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Moses</span> Benson was as good as his word in the matter
of books of adventure. Dirty books, some without
backs, and some with very greasy ones (for which, if
I bought them, I seldom paid more than half-price),
but full of dangers and discoveries, the mightiness of
manhood, and the wonders of the world. I read
them at odd moments of my working hours, and
dreamed of them when I went home to bed. And
it was more fascinating still to look out, with Charlie&rsquo;s
help, in the Penny Numbers, for the foreign places,
and people, and creatures mentioned in the tales, and
to find that the truth was often stranger than the
fiction.</p>

<p>To live a fancy-life of adventure in my own head,
was not merely an amusement to me at this time&mdash;it
was a refuge. Matters did not really improve between
<!-- Page 204 -->me and my father, though I had obeyed his wishes.
It was by his arrangement that I spent so much of
my time at home with the Woods, and yet it remained
a grievance that I liked to do so. Whether my dear
mother had given up all hopes of my becoming a
genius I do not know, but my father&rsquo;s contempt for
my absorption in a book was unabated. I felt this
if he came suddenly upon me with my head in my
hands and my nose in a tattered volume; and if I
went on with my reading it was with a sense of being
in the wrong, whilst if I shut up the book and tried
to throw myself into outside interests, my father&rsquo;s
manner showed me that my efforts had only discredited
my candour.</p>

<p>As is commonly the case, it was chiefly little things
that pulled the wrong way of the stuff of life between
us, but they pulled it very much askew. I was
selfishly absorbed in my own dreams, and I think my
dear father made a mistake which is a too common
bit of tyranny between people who love each other
and live together. He was not satisfied with my
<i>doing</i> what he liked, he expected me to <i>be</i> what
he liked, that is, to be another person instead of
myself. Wives and daughters seem now and then to
respond to this expectation as to the call of duty, and
to become inconsistent echoes, odd mixtures of severity
and hesitancy, hypocrites on the highest grounds; but
<!-- Page 205 -->sons are not often so self-effacing, and it was not the
case with me. It was so much the case with my dear
mother, that she never was of the slightest use (which
she might have been) when my father and I misunderstood
each other. By my father&rsquo;s views of the
moment she always hastily set her own, whether they
were fair or unfair to me; and she made up for it by
indulging me at every point that did not cross an expressed
wish of my father&rsquo;s, or that could not annoy
him because he was not there. She never held the
scales between us.</p>

<p>And yet it was the thought of her which kept me
from taking my fate into my own hands again and
again. To have obeyed my father seemed to have
done so little towards making him satisfied with me,
that I found no consolation at home for the distastefulness
of the office; and more than once I resolved
to run away, and either enlist or go to Liverpool
(which was at no great distance from us) and get on
board some vessel that was about to sail for other
lands. But when I thought of my mother&rsquo;s distress,
I could not face it, and I let my half-formed projects
slide again.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, it was Uncle Henry who brought
matters to a crisis. I think my father was disappointed
(though he did not blame me) that I secured
no warmer a place in Uncle Henry&rsquo;s affections than I
<!-- Page 206 -->did. Uncle Henry had no children, and if he took a
fancy to me and I pleased him, such a career as the
Jew-clerk had sketched for me would probably be
mine. This dawned on me by degrees through
chance remarks from my father and the more open
comments of friends. For good manners with us
were not of a sensitively refined order, and to be
clapped on the back with&mdash;&ldquo;Well, Jack, you&rsquo;ve got
into a good berth, I hear. I suppose you look to succeed
your uncle some day?&rdquo; was reckoned a friendly
familiarity rather than an offensive impertinence.</p>

<p>I learned that my parents had hoped that, as I
was his nephew, Uncle Henry would take me as
clerk without the usual premium. Indeed, when my
uncle first urged my going to him, he had more than
hinted that he should not expect a premium with his
brother&rsquo;s son. But he was fond of his money (of
which he had plenty), and when people are that, they
are apt to begin to grudge, if there is time, between
promise and performance. Uncle Henry had a
whole year in which to think about foregoing two or
three hundred pounds, and as it drew to a close, it
seemed to worry him to such a degree, that he proposed
to take me for half the usual premium instead
of completely remitting it; and he said something
about my being a stupid sort of boy, and of very
little use to him for some time to come. He said it
<!-- Page 207 -->to justify himself for drawing back, I am quite sure,
but it did me no good at home.</p>

<p>My father had plenty of honourable pride, and
he would hear of no compromise. He said that he
should pay the full premium for me that Uncle Henry&rsquo;s
other clerks had had to pay, and from this no revulsion
of feeling on my uncle&rsquo;s part would move him.
He was quite bland with Uncle Henry, and he was
not quite bland towards me.</p>

<p>When I fairly grasped the situation (and I contrived
to get a pretty clear account of it from my
mother), there rushed upon me the conviction that
a new phase had come over my prospects. When I
put aside my own longings for my father&rsquo;s will; and
every time that office life seemed intolerable to me,
and I was tempted to break my bonds, and thought
better of it and settled down again, this thought had
always remained behind: &ldquo;I will try; and if the
worst comes to the worst, and I really cannot settle
down into a clerk, I can but run away then.&rdquo; But
circumstances had altered my case, I felt that now I
must make up my mind for good and all. My father
would have to make some little sacrifices to find the
money, and when it was once paid, I could not let it
be in vain. Come what might, I must stick to the
office then, and for life.</p>

<p>Some weeks passed whilst I was turning this over
<!-- Page 208 -->and over in my mind. I was constantly forgetting
things in the office, but Moses Benson helped me out
of every scrape. He was kinder and kinder, so that I
often felt sorry that I could not feel fonder of him, and
that his notions of fun and amusement only disgusted
me instead of making us friends. They convinced
me of one thing. My dear mother&rsquo;s chief dread
about my going out of my own country was for the
wicked ways I might learn in strange lands. A town
with an unpronounceable name suggested foreign
iniquities to her tender fears, but our own town, where
she and everybody we knew bought everything we
daily used, did not frighten her at all. I did not tell
her, but I was quite convinced myself that I might
get pretty deep into mischief in my idle hours, even if
I lived within five miles of home, and had only my
uncle&rsquo;s clerks for my comrades.</p>

<p>During these weeks Jem came home for the
holidays. He was at a public school now, which
many of our friends regarded as an extravagant folly
on my father&rsquo;s part. We had a very happy time
together, and this would have gone far to keep me at
home, if it had not, at the same time, deepened my
disgust with our town, and my companions in the
office. In plain English, the training of two good
schools, and the society of boys superior to himself,
had made a gentleman of Jem, and the contrast be<!-- Page 209 -->tween
his looks and ways, and manners, and those of
my uncle&rsquo;s clerks were not favourable to the latter.
How proud my father was of him! With me he was
in a most irritable mood; and one grumble to which I
heard him give utterance, that it was very inconvenient
to have to pay this money just at the most expensive
period of Jem&rsquo;s education, went heavily into the
scale for running away. And that night, as it happened,
Jem and I sat up late, and had a long and
loving chat. He abused the office to my heart&rsquo;s content,
and was very sympathetic when I told him that
I had wished to go to sea, and how my father had
refused to allow me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he made a great mistake,&rdquo; said Jem; and
he told me of &ldquo;a fellow&rsquo;s brother&rdquo; that he knew
about, who was in the Merchant Service, and how well
he was doing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not even as if Uncle Henry were
coming out generously,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Dear, dear! How pleasant it was to hear somebody
else talk on my side of the question. And who
was I that I should rebuke Jem for calling our worthy
uncle a curmudgeon, and stigmatising the Jew-clerk as
a dirty beast? I really dared not tell him that Moses
grew more familiar as my time to be articled drew
near; that he called me Jack Sprat, and his dearest
friend, and offered to procure me the &ldquo;silver-top&rdquo;
(or champagne)&mdash;which he said I must &ldquo;stand&rdquo; on
<!-- Page 210 -->the day I took my place at the fellow desk to his&mdash;of
the first quality and at less than cost price; and that
he had provided me gratis with a choice of &ldquo;excuses&rdquo;
(they were unblushing lies) to give to our good
mother for spending that evening in town, and &ldquo;having
a spree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From my affairs we came to talk of Jem&rsquo;s, and I
found that even he, poor chap! was not without his
troubles. He confided to me, with many expressions
of shame and vexation, that he had got into debt, but
having brought home good reports and even a prize on
this occasion, he hoped to persuade my father to pay
what he owed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Jack, he&rsquo;s awfully good to me, but he
will do things his own way, and what&rsquo;s worse, the way
they were done in his young days. You remember the
row we had about his giving me an allowance? He
didn&rsquo;t want to, because he never had one, only tips
from his governor when the old gentleman was pleased
with him. And he said it was quite enough to send
me to such a good and expensive school, and I ought
to think of that, and not want more because I had got
much. We&rsquo;d an awful row, for I thought it was so
unfair his making out I was greedy and ungrateful, and
I told him so, and I said I was quite game to go to a
cheap school if he liked, only wherever I was I did
want to be &lsquo;like the other fellows.&rsquo; I begged him to
<!-- Page 211 -->take me away and to let me go somewhere cheap with
you; and I said, if the fellows there had no allowances,
we could do without. As I told him, it&rsquo;s not the
beastly things that you buy that you care about, only
of course you don&rsquo;t like to be the only fellow who can&rsquo;t
buy &rsquo;em. So then he came round, and said I should
have an allowance, but I must do with a very small
one. So I said, Very well, then I mustn&rsquo;t go in for the
games. Then he wouldn&rsquo;t have that; so then I made
out a list of what the subscriptions are to cricket, and
so on, and then your flannels and shoes, and it came
to double what he offered me. He said it was simply
disgraceful that boys shouldn&rsquo;t be able to be properly
educated, and have an honest game at cricket for the
huge price he paid, without the parents being fleeced
for all sorts of extravagances at exorbitant prices.
And I know well enough it&rsquo;s disgraceful, what we have
to pay for school books and for things of all sorts you
have to get in the town; but, as I said to the governor,
why don&rsquo;t you kick up a dust with the head master, or
write to the papers&mdash;what&rsquo;s the good of rowing us?
One must have what other fellows have, and get &rsquo;em
where other fellows get &rsquo;em. But he never did&mdash;I
wish he would. I should enjoy fighting old Pompous
if I were in his place. But they&rsquo;re as civil as butter
to each other, and then old Pompous goes on
feathering his nest, and backing up the tradespeople,
<!-- Page 212 -->and the governor pitches into the young men of the
present day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did give you the bigger allowance, didn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; said I, at this pause in Jem&rsquo;s rhetoric.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did. He&rsquo;s awfully good to me. But
you know, Jack, he never paid it quite all, and he
never paid it quite in time. I found out from my
mother he did it on purpose to make me value it
more, and be more careful. Doesn&rsquo;t it seem odd he
shouldn&rsquo;t see that I can&rsquo;t pay the subscriptions a few
shillings short or a few days late? One must find the
money somehow, and then one has to pay for that,
and then you&rsquo;re short, and go on tick, and it runs up,
and then they dun you, and you&rsquo;re cleaned out, and
there you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At which climax old Jem laid his curly head on his
arms, and I began to think very seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much do you owe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jem couldn&rsquo;t say. He thought he could reckon
up, so I got a pencil and made a list from his dictation,
and from his memory, which was rather vague. When
it was done (and there seemed to be a misty margin
beyond), I was horrified. &ldquo;Why, my dear fellow!&rdquo; I
exclaimed, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d had your allowance ever so
regularly, it wouldn&rsquo;t have covered this sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; said poor Jem, clutching
remorsefully at his curls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a regular fool!
<!-- Page 213 -->Jack! whatever you do&mdash;never tick. It&rsquo;s the very
mischief. You never know what you owe, and so
you feel vague and order more. And you never know
what you don&rsquo;t owe, which is worse, for sometimes
you&rsquo;re in such despair, it would be quite a relief to
catch some complaint and die. It&rsquo;s like going about
with a stone round your neck, and nobody kind
enough to drown you. I can&rsquo;t stand any more of it.
I shall make a clean breast to Father, and if he can&rsquo;t
set me straight, I won&rsquo;t go back; I&rsquo;ll work on the
farm sooner, and let him pay my bills instead of my
schooling&mdash;and serve old Pompous right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Jem! long after he had cheered up and gone
to bed, I sat up and thought. When my premium
was paid where was the money for Jem&rsquo;s debts to
come from? And would my father be in the humour
to pay them? If he did not, Jem would not go back
to school. Of that I was quite certain. Jem had
thought over his affairs, which was an effort for him,
but he always thought in one direction. His thoughts
never went backwards and forwards as mine did. If
he had made up his mind, there was no more prospect
of his changing it than if he had been my father. And
if the happy terms between them were broken, and
Jem&rsquo;s career checked when he was doing so well!&mdash;the
scales that weighed my own future were becoming
very uneven now.</p>

<p><!-- Page 214 -->I clasped my hands and thought. If I ran away,
the money would be there for Jem&rsquo;s debts, and his
errors would look pale in the light of my audacity, and
he would be dearer than ever at home, whilst for me
were freedom, independence (for I had not a doubt
of earning bread-and-cheese, if only as a working
man): perhaps a better understanding with my father
when I had been able to prove my courage and
industry, or even when he got the temperate and
dutiful letter I meant to post to him when I was fairly
off; and beyond all, the desire of my eyes, the sight of
the world.</p>

<p>Should I stay now? And for what? To see old
Jem at logger-heads with my father, and perhaps
demoralized by an inferior school? To turn my own
back and shut my eyes for ever on all that the wide
seas embrace; my highest goal to be to grow as rich
as Uncle Henry or richer, and perhaps as mean or
meaner? Should I choose for life a life I hated, and
set seals to my choice by drinking silver-top with the
Jew-clerk?&mdash;No, Moses, no!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I got up soon after dawn and was in the garden at
sunrise the morning that I ran away. I had made
my plans carefully, and carried them out, so far with
success.</p>

<p>Including the old miser&rsquo;s bequest which his lawyer
<!-- Page 215 -->had paid, there were thirteen pounds to my name in
the town savings-bank, and this sum I had drawn out
to begin life with. I wrapped a five-pound note in a
loving letter to Jem, and put both into the hymn-book
on his shelf&mdash;I knew it would not be opened till
Sunday. Very few runaways have as much as eight
pounds to make a start with: and as one could not be
quite certain how my father would receive Jem&rsquo;s
confession, I thought he might be glad of a few pounds
of his own, and I knew he had spent his share of the
miser&rsquo;s money long ago.</p>

<p>I meant to walk to a station about seven miles
distant, and there take train for Liverpool. I should
be clumsy indeed, I thought, if I could not stow away
on board some vessel, as hundreds of lads had done
before me, and make myself sufficiently useful to pay
my passage when I was found out.</p>

<p>When I got into the garden I kicked my foot
against something in the grass. It was my mother&rsquo;s
little gardening-fork. She had been tidying her pet
perennial border, and my father had called her hastily,
and she had left it half finished, and had forgotten the
fork. A few minutes more or less were of no great
importance to me, for it was very early, so I finished
the border quite neatly, and took the fork indoors.</p>

<p>I put it in a corner of the hall where the light was
growing stronger and making familiar objects clear.
<!-- Page 216 -->In a house like ours and amongst people like us,
furniture was not chopped and changed and decorated
as it is now. The place had looked like this ever
since I could remember, and it would look like this
tomorrow morning, though my eyes would not see it.
I stood stupidly by the hall table where my father&rsquo;s
gloves lay neatly one upon the other beside his hat.
I took them up, almost mechanically, and separated
them, and laid them together again finger to finger, and
thumb to thumb, and held them with a stupid sort of
feeling, as if I could never put them down and go away.</p>

<p>What would my father&rsquo;s face be like when he took
them up this very morning to go out and look for me?
and when&mdash;oh when!&mdash;should I see his face again?</p>

<p>I began to feel what one is apt to learn too late,
that in childhood one takes the happiness of home for
granted, and kicks against the pricks of its grievances,
not having felt the far harder buffetings of the world.
Moreover (which one does not think of then), that
parental blunders and injustices are the mistakes and
tyrannies of a special love that one may go many
a mile on one&rsquo;s own wilful way and not meet a second
time. Who&mdash;in the wide world&mdash;would care to be
bothered with my confidence, and blame me for
withholding it? Should I meet many people to whom
it would matter if we misunderstood each other?
Would anybody hereafter love me well enough to be
<!-- Page 217 -->disappointed in me? Would other men care so
much for my fate as to insist on guiding it by lines of
their own ruling?</p>

<p>I pressed the gloves passionately against my eyes
to keep in the tears. If my day-dreams had been the
only question, I should have changed my mind now.
If the home grievances had been all, I should have
waited for time and patience to mend them. I could
not have broken all these heart-strings. I should
never have run away. But there was much more, and
my convictions were not changed, though I felt as if I
might have managed better as regards my father.</p>

<p>Would he forgive me? I hoped and believed so.
Would my mother forgive me? I knew she would&mdash;as
<span class="smcap">God</span> forgives.</p>

<p>And with the thought of her, I knelt down, and
put my head on the hall table and prayed from my
soul&mdash;not for fair winds, and prosperous voyages, and
good luck, and great adventures; but that it might
please <span class="smcap">God</span> to let me see Home again, and the faces
that I loved, ah, so dearly, after all!</p>

<p>And then I got up, and crossed the threshold, and
went out into the world.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
